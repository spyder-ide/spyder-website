It is a pleasure for us on the Spyder team to work every day to improve the workflow of developers, scientists, engineers and data analysts.
We are very glad to receive and share a STX Next testimonial about Spyder, along with an interview with one of their developers, <a href="https://github.com/Michael-Wisniewski" rel="nofollow" class="link">Michael Wiśniewski</a>, who has found Spyder very useful in his job.`,p,d,a='<img src="stxnext.jpg" alt="The Company"/><figcaption>The Company</figcaption>',u,c,de="What Michael Wiśniewski says about Spyder",Q,w,ye=`In an era of a continuously growing demand for analysis of vast amounts of data, we are facing increasingly complex tasks to perform.
Sure, we are not alone—there are many great tools designed for scientists and data analysts.
We have NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, and others.
But, wouldn’t it be nice to have one extra tool that could combine all the required packages into one compact working environment? Asking this question is precisely how my journey with Spyder began.`,V,b,ce=`In my opinion, Spyder is the go-to-solution that helps to speed up the data analysis processes.
For me, the biggest strength of this IDE is that it has all the benefits of Matlab/RStudio and makes them available to the Pythonista community.
It provides us with an easy-to-organize workspace that accommodates code, visualizations and shell in just one window.
Besides, the pane called variable explorer allows direct access to all data placed in the memory.`,C,x,ke=`Another cool feature is the tool’s integration with Jupyter notebooks.
Just open and browse different notebooks without thinking about server-side and file paths.

After hours, my colleagues and I run a machine learning community of practice.

One time, I used it for a project that relied on machine learning algorithms to assess risk based on documents provided by a user.
Since Spyder aggregates out-of-the-box the most <a href="https://www.stxnext.com/blog/most-popular-python-scientific-libraries/" rel="nofollow" class="link">popular scientific Python packages</a>, it was used during the whole development process, from data pre-processing and visualization to assessment of the final solution.`,ge,ne,Ne=`Another time, Spyder proved to be very helpful in a project involving the analysis of ancient religious texts.
The task was to create a script that would check file integrity and the correctness of the texts themselves.
Because of the large size of the data sets, the script had to be efficient and able to handle a lot of edge cases.
A built-in ipdb debugger and script profiler (together with the Spyder-memory-profiler plugin) was very helpful in achieving this goal.`,xe,X,Re=`To me, this IDE is also a great tool for conducting workshops.

We can easily test several sets of given parameter values and examine how that affects a given function by observing charts.`,Ge,He,ot=`Interactive window tools often simplify and speed up code analysis.

However, limited remote development support compared to some other IDEs has hindered adoption, as many users would like to work with data and code on high performance computing (HPC) clusters or cloud providers like AWS, GCP or DigitalOcean while developing on their personal computers. Adding such features would open up many new research possibilities by enabling the scientific community to tackle data and compute-intensive programming tasks from the ease and efficiency of their local development environments. Thanks to a two-year grant from the <a href="https://chanzuckerberg.com/" rel="nofollow" class="link">Chan Zuckerberg Initiative</a>, we will be now able to address this shortcoming.`,p,d,a=`Right now, users have two main options to work remotely using a local IDE (aside from a purely web browser-based approach, which is sometimes not available or desirable):
They can either edit and execute their files in a terminal, which is not user-friendly; or start their IDE on the server and display it locally, which is typically slow, resource-intensive and difficult to set up. Furthermore, scientists typically find it difficult to sync remote files to the local machine and version control their code on the remote one, so remote changes are often lost, out of sync or difficult to integrate with code developed locally.`,u,c,de=`To address this situation, we will add and enhance support for local Spyder installations to run code and sync files on remote servers and clusters.
The first step in that direction is to enhance the existing remote code execution features in Spyder, as the current workflow is error-prone and quite cumbersome.
It requires users to install the Spyder-Kernels package on the remote machine, manually start a kernel on it and provide the kernel connection file to the local machine.`,Q,w,ye='<img src="remote-kernel-connection.png" alt="Dialog to create a connection to a remote kernel"/><figcaption>Dialog to create a connection to a remote kernel</figcaption>',V,b,ce="Since Spyder does not currently have a way to identify and store state changes, users currently have to repeat this costly setup process if there are any configuration modifications on the remote machine.

One thing the Variable Explorer is missing is the ability to display the value of arbitrary, user-definable expressions while debugging.
For example, it might be useful to see the value of a specific attribute of an object, or the value of an array at some index.
Such a feature is known as a “watchlist” or “watches” in other Integrated Development Environments (IDEs).
This blog post introduces the Watchlist plugin developed for Spyder.`,p,d,a="Features",u,c,de=`The watchlist consists of a user-definable list of expressions.
They are evaluated after each debugger step, and the result of the evaluation is displayed as a string.
This means that <code>value = str(eval(expression))</code> is performed behind the scenes, and the result is shown in the plugin.
The watchlist is a very powerful tool, but this comes at a cost: Any side effect of an expression will affect the execution environment.`,Q,w,ye=`Expressions can be added, removed and modified at any time.
The value of an invalid expression is shown as <code>&lt;exception name&gt;</code>.

Two of the biggest changes—user-selectable syntax highlighting themes, and enhanced external editor/IDE integration—are already built right into Spyder, so they’ll likely be of more interest if you use QtConsole standalone or with another editor/IDE.
However, most of the other changes should prove quite useful within Spyder as well, and many were in fact suggested and even implemented by users of our IDE.
Particular highlights include a block indent/unindent feature, Select-All (<code>Ctrl-Shift-A</code>) being made cell-specific, <code>Ctrl-Backspace</code> and <code>Ctrl-Delete</code> behaving more intelligently across whitespace and line boundaries, <code>Ctrl-D</code> allowing you to easily exit <code>ipdb</code>, <code>input()</code> and the like, and numerous smaller enhancements and bug fixes.

There’s also a brand-new error reporting process, new options in the IPython console, usability and performance improvements for the Variable Explorer, multiple new and changed dependency requirements and more, so there’s plenty to go over.
Finally, we’d like to briefly share a few final notes on this release and the latest on our plans going forward.`,u,c,de="Modular, flexible Console architecture",Q,w,ye=`The biggest single change with version 3.3.0/3.3.1 is a major overhaul of how IPython Consoles are started and managed in Spyder.
More precisely, we’ve moved all the kernel-related code from the Spyder core into a new modular package, <code>spyder-kernels</code>, available on the <a href="https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder-kernels" rel="nofollow" class="link">same</a> <a href="https://pypi.org/project/spyder-kernels/" rel="nofollow" class="link">distribution</a> <a href="https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/spyder-kernels" rel="nofollow" class="link">channels</a> as Spyder itself (and installed automatically when updating to &gt;=3.3.0).
While the most dramatic differences are under the hood, there’s plenty for everyone to like (and a few things to be aware of).`,V,b,ce=`Most importantly, for our everyday users, this makes Spyder much more flexible and powerful when working with multiple Python environments.
With the changes, Spyder itself does not need to be present in every environment you’d like to launch a kernel in; you can install the full IDE in whatever manner you prefer, and then set it to run code and consoles in any Anaconda environment, <code>virtualenv</code>/<code>venv</code>, or even a totally separate Python installation, so long as it has <code>spyder-kernels</code> package available.
Just set the path under <code>Tools -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Python interpreter -&gt; Use the following Python interpreter</code> to the desired Python executable, and any new Console you open will start in the selected environment.
Check out our <a href="https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/wiki/Working-with-packages-and-environments-in-Spyder" rel="nofollow" class="link">new wiki page on using environments with Spyder</a>, for more details and tips on the subject, and keep an eye out for the further improvements coming in Spyder 4, which will greatly simplify the process and include full GUI-based project, package and environment management functionality built right in.`,C,x,ke='<img src="spyder-prefs-python.png" alt="Python interpreter pane of the Spyder preferences dialog, with the &#39;Use the following Python interpreter&#39; option highlighted"/><figcaption>Python interpreter pane of the Spyder preferences dialog, with the &#39;Use the following Python interpreter&#39; option highlighted</figcaption>',oe,T,fe=`Furthermore, the new package allows you to independently launch a kernel from anywhere (on your local computer, or a remote machine, server or even supercomputing cluster), connect to it with Spyder, and use it just like a “natively” started one.
After installing <code>spyder-kernels</code> on the host environment, you can start one with <code>python -m spyder_kernels.console</code>, and then enter the kernel’s 4-digit ID (and SSH connection details, if a remote machine) in the Spyder <code>Connect to an existing kernel</code> dialog under the IPython Console pane context- or “gear”-menu).
For more information on the process, see the <a href="https://docs.spyder-ide.org/ipythonconsole.html#connecting-to-a-console" rel="nofollow" class="link">Connecting to a Console</a> section in our new documentation.`,ie,_,se='<img src="spyder-remote-kernel.png" alt="A remote kernel running in a system console alongside Spyder&#39;s connect to kernel dialog"/><figcaption>A remote kernel running in a system console alongside Spyder&#39;s connect to kernel dialog</figcaption>',G,S,Te=`Best of all, no matter how or where a kernel is started, every console now supports the full suite of Spyder’s features, including completion, the Variable Explorer, interactive Help and more, unlike before.
You can even mix and match internal, external and remote kernels in different environments, all in the same Spyder session, by either changing the Python interpreter preferences setting between starting a console, or starting and connecting to multiple consoles externally—or both!
Finally, for those of us (and those of you!) who help develop Spyder, the changes also make it easier to maintain and improve the code, and opens the door to one of the biggest features coming in Spyder 4: a new, full-featured debugging kernel that many of you have been asking for.`,O,M,Se=`The one key thing to remember: make sure you install the appropriate version of <code>spyder-kernels</code> for your version of Spyder. For most users, that will be spyder-kernels 0.x (currently 0.2.6) to match Spyder 3 on our stable <code>3.x</code> branch; if testing a Spyder 4 beta or Github clone of the <code>master</code> branch, you’ll want the latest 1.x version of <code>spyder-kernels</code> (currently 1.1.0).
To install the correct build, you can use the following <code>conda</code> command,`,P,m,be,me='<code class="language-bash">conda <span class="token function">install</span> spyder-kernels<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token operator">&lt;</span><span class="token number">0</span> or <span class="token operator"><span class="token file-descriptor important">1</span>></span>.*</code>',B,Ie,pe="or with <code>pip</code>,",K,je,W,z='<code class="language-bash">pip <span class="token function">install</span> spyder-kernels<span class="token operator">==</span><span class="token operator">&lt;</span><span class="token number">0</span> or <span class="token operator"><span class="token file-descriptor important">1</span>></span>.*</code>',Ae,R,D=`replacing <code>&lt;0 or 1&gt;</code> with the major version number (0 or 1) to match your Spyder version.

This allows for advanced completion functionality on objects not yet assigned to a variable, similar to the existing “greedy” completion option, but without the need for dynamic evaluation.
It can be slow if working with very large Pandas <code>DataFrames</code> so it is disabled by default, but you can activate it under <code>Tools -&gt; Preferences -&gt; IPython console -&gt; Advanced Settings -&gt; Jedi completion</code>.
The descriptive text for the “greedy” completion option (also off by default) was also clarified, particularly to explain an IPython bug (not present in the <code>jedi</code> completer) with the feature and a consequent workaround.`,We,g,L='<img src="tight-layout-preferences.png" alt="Graphics tab of the IPython console pane of Spyder&#39;s preferences, with the new &#39;Use a tight layout for inline plots&#39; option highlighted"/><figcaption>Graphics tab of the IPython console pane of Spyder&#39;s preferences, with the new &#39;Use a tight layout for inline plots&#39; option highlighted</figcaption>',Ve,U,J=`We’ve also added a new plotting setting, <code>Use a tight layout for inline plots</code>, for the <code>Inline</code> Matplotlib graphics backend.
The default behavior (as in previous Spyder versions) sets <code>bbox_inches</code> to <code>&quot;tight&quot;</code> in Matplotlib calls when drawing to the inline backend.
However, if you prefer your own <code>bbox_inches</code> argument be respected even when plots are rendered in the Console, you can now do so by unchecking this option under <code>Tools -&gt; Preferences -&gt; IPython console -&gt; Graphics -&gt; Inline backend</code>.`,Ze,N,Y='<img src="plot-comparison.png" alt="Comparison of inline plots in Spyder&#39;s IPython Console with and without the &#39;tight layout&#39; option set"/><figcaption>Comparison of inline plots in Spyder&#39;s IPython Console with and without the &#39;tight layout&#39; option set</figcaption>',Ye,Fe,we="Better Variable Explorer usability and performance",Xe,$e,ve=`We’ve made several changes and optimizations to greatly improve performance and efficiency in the Variable Explorer, to make it much faster and use less memory when opening and editing large objects.
In particular, we’ve fixed several major memory leaks when saving edited objects and closing the Variable Explorer dialogs through better length validation and garbage collection, and now skip the whole saving process entirely if the object was not modified (or cannot be modified).
We’ve also changed the names and functions of the <code>Cancel</code> and <code>Ok</code> buttons in Variable Explorer dialogs to be easier to understand and use.
They now feature a <code>Close</code> button which exits the dialog without saving any edits to the object’s contents, and a <code>Save and Close</code> button—automatically enabled once modifications are made—that commits the changes back to the kernel.`,Be,q,ee='<img src="variable-explorer-ux.png" alt="A Variable Explorer DataFrame editor dialog, showing the new &#39;Close&#39; and &#39;Save and Close&#39; buttons"/><figcaption>A Variable Explorer DataFrame editor dialog, showing the new &#39;Close&#39; and &#39;Save and Close&#39; buttons</figcaption>',tt,Ge,He="Streamlined error reporting experience",ot,De,Me=`While we hope you never need to use it, Spyder 3.3.0 includes a brand-new error handling backend that can submit bug reports directly through the Github API.

Just as before, we won’t send anything without your explicit consent, you need a Github account (or create one for free), and you can view and edit the report on Github at any time.`,it,ze,Pe='<img src="new-authent-dialog-both.png" alt="The new authentication dialogs for submitting a Github report, with a username/password and a token option"/><figcaption>The new authentication dialogs for submitting a Github report, with a username/password and a token option</figcaption>',nt,A,te=`You will need to enter your Github credentials the first time you submit a report.

Either way, Spyder can securely remember your login using the <a href="https://github.com/jaraco/keyring" rel="nofollow" class="link"><code>keyring</code></a> package, so you only have to do this once on any given machine (if you select the “remember” option).`,at,Qe,Le='<img src="new-error-dialog-full.png" alt="The new error reporting interface, with a title field, more descriptive text, and a polished UI"/><figcaption>The new error reporting interface, with a title field, more descriptive text, and a polished UI</figcaption>',lt,Je,Ee=`The dialog itself has also been made more functional and user-friendly, designed to help encourage high-quality, useful reports, and with more accessible, descriptive text.
The reports themselves also contain more useful data about the problem, and there is now a <code>--safe-mode</code> command-line option for Spyder to start in a clean, temporary config directly, so you can test to see if the problem reoccurs without the hassle of a <code>spyder --reset</code>, and play around with other settings without impacting your main configuration. Finally, we’ve fixed over 40 bugs in this release and further improved our documentation and troubleshooting material, so hopefully you’ll see this less often.`,et,h,E="Cleaner under the hood and more",st,ut,Ke=`Alongside the aforementioned internal changes, we’ve also made a number of other under-the-hood changes to clean out old cruft and improve maintainability, readability and performance of our codebase.
In particular, we’ve officially dropped support for Python 3.3, PyQt4, and PyQt5 under 5.5, all versions which have been end-of-life for years, and (aside from PyQt4) have minimal or no remaining Spyder users.
Furthermore, dropping <code>PyQt4</code> in particular allows us to avoid or resolve a number of unfixable bugs specific to that version that have been causing problems for users, and opens the door to easier development in the future.
Finally, we moved our legacy documentation (and its many associated images) from the main Spyder codebase to <a href="https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder-docs" rel="nofollow" class="link">its own repo</a>, executed a major overhaul to greatly modernize and expand the text, images, style, and presentation, and now deploy them onto <a href="https://docs.spyder-ide.org/" rel="nofollow" class="link">their own subdomain of our site</a>, all of which we will discuss in a separate post coming soon.`,rt,F,le="Even more fixes and refinements with Spyder 3.3.1",dt,$,y=`As a quick follow-on to the 3.3.0 release, Spyder 3.3.1 fixed a handful of bugs and minor issues with the new functionality and cleaned up several other existing ones, as well made a number of lower-level maintenance and development-oriented changes—over two dozen in all.
Furthermore, several user-visible enhancements made it into the release, primary aimed at improving usability.
To make it easier for users to manage multiple environments, the selection UI under <code>Preferences &gt; Python interpreter &gt; Use the following Python interpreter</code> remembers the executables you’ve previously selected and allows quick switching between them.`,he,_t,Lt='<img src="interpreter-selection-ux.png" alt="Python interpreter pane of Spyder&#39;s preferences, showing the new environment selection UI"/><figcaption>Python interpreter pane of Spyder&#39;s preferences, showing the new environment selection UI</figcaption>',At,Ct,Ft=`In the Console, mundane <code>ipdb</code> commands are automatically filtered from the history, and the Editor now supports syntax highlighting for the <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0515/" rel="nofollow" class="link">new numeric literal syntax</a> introduced in Python 3.6.
Spyder’s tutorial has been re-written for modern Spyder as well as to be clearer and more understandable, and overhauled for better and more consistent formatting and visuals with the rest of our documentation.
Finally, our update checker now consults the Anaconda <code>defaults</code> channel rather than PyPI to determine if an update is available, so it doesn’t bug the majority of our users on Anaconda until they can actually acquire the package.`,Gt,Tt,It="What to know and what’s next",zt,St,jt=`If you have any questions, problems or feedback, we’d love to hear from you (just make sure you read our <a href="https://docs.spyder-ide.org/" rel="nofollow" class="link">documentation</a>, <a href="https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/wiki/Troubleshooting-Guide-and-FAQ" rel="nofollow" class="link">Troubleshooting Guide</a> and the other previously-mentioned resources first)!

I decided to wait until now to write a blogpost about it because shortly after the initial release, we found several critical performance issues and some regressions with respect to Spyder 3, most of which are fixed now in <a href="https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/releases/tag/v4.1.3" rel="nofollow" class="link">version 4.1.3</a>, released on May 8th 2020.`,u,c,de=`This new release comes with a lengthy list of user-requested features aimed at providing an enhanced development experience at the level of top general-purpose editors and IDEs, while strengthening Spyder’s specialized focus on scientific programming in Python.
The interested reader can take a look at some of them in <a href="https://www.spyder-ide.org/blog/spyder-variable-explorer/" rel="nofollow" class="link">previous</a> <a href="https://www.spyder-ide.org/blog/spyder-files-improvements/" rel="nofollow" class="link">blog</a> <a href="https://www.spyder-ide.org/blog/spyder-kite-funding/" rel="nofollow" class="link">posts</a>, and in detail in our <a href="https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#version-400-2019-12-06" rel="nofollow" class="link">Changelog</a>.
However, this post is not meant to describe those improvements, but to acknowledge all people that contributed to making Spyder 4 possible.`,Q,w,ye=`Spyder 4 is the first version developed with financial support from multiple companies and organizations, as well as donations by the international user community.
However, as a project, we couldn’t have been able to reach the level of maturity needed to receive and handle that support without the pivotal opportunities Travis Oliphant, former CEO of Anaconda and current leader of Quansight, gave me to work in Scientific Python.
Thanks to him, I became part of Anaconda Inc. in 2015; I was able to hire a small small team to improve Spyder within Anaconda in late 2016; and I was hired by Quansight to work solely on Spyder in 2018.
As with other projects in our ecosystem, such as <a href="https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh" rel="nofollow" class="link">Bokeh</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dask/dask" rel="nofollow" class="link">Dask</a> and <a href="https://github.com/numba/numba" rel="nofollow" class="link">Numba</a>, Spyder benefited immensely from Travis’ trust in the role these efforts and ours could play in the future.
He certainly believed in the vision their maintainers worked so hard to make a reality, even if their beginnings were humble and their chances of survival uncertain.
Therefore, my first big acknowledgment is to Travis: thanks for giving us a chance!`,V,b,ce=`I also want to thank our community for its continued support.
As I’ve witnessed during my years as Spyder’s lead developer, many newbies and veterans alike keep choosing Spyder as their primary tool for scientific programming in Python.
It’s really you, the members of this fantastic community, which keep Spyder relevant in a highly competitive field by using and contributing back to it.
Furthermore, when the future looked grim, after my team and I were let go from Anaconda at the end of 2017 (not by Travis’ decision), a lot of users came to our rescue by making donations through our <a href="https://opencollective.com/spyder" rel="nofollow" class="link">Open Collective page</a>.
That, and a NumFOCUS development grant we received the next year, filled us with confidence and allowed us to continue with Spyder’s development in 2018, even after losing part of our team in the process.`,C,x,ke=`Last year it was also a pleasant surprise to learn that several companies were interested in seeing Spyder prosper and thrive.
Through Quansight Labs and its <a href="https://labs.quansight.org/blog/2019/05/community-driven-opensource-funded-development/" rel="nofollow" class="link">Community Work Order</a> concept, we were able to sign contracts with two of them: <a href="https://www.micronas.tdk.com/en" rel="nofollow" class="link">TDK-Micronas</a> and <a href="https://kite.com/" rel="nofollow" class="link">Kite</a>.
Their support was critical to finish Spyder 4 because it allowed me to hire most of my old Anaconda team back, plus two new additions, to work full-time on the project.
Therefore, I can’t thank them enough for showing up just at the right time!`,oe,T,fe=`And finally, even when I am often seen as the public face of Spyder, due to my presence in our <a href="https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/issues" rel="nofollow" class="link">issue tracker</a> and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/438386/carlos-cordoba" rel="nofollow" class="link">Stack Overflow</a>, it’s really the Spyder team that is in charge of implementing new features and fixing most bugs.
So my last round of acknowledgments goes to them.
I was fortunate enough to convince some of the most talented Colombian software developers to work for the project, and to attract the interest of several other equally accomplished developers from around the world.
All of them did a hell of a job in this release!`,ie,_,se=`<a href="https://github.com/jnsebgosselin" rel="nofollow" class="link">Jean-Sébastien Gosselin</a> contributed our new Plots pane in its entirety; <a href="https://github.com/impact27" rel="nofollow" class="link">Quentin Peter</a> did a complete re-architecting of our IPython console, which enabled numerous improvements to our debugger; <a href="https://github.com/jitseniesen" rel="nofollow" class="link">Jitse Niesen</a> added auto-saving functionality to our editor; <a href="https://github.com/bcolsen" rel="nofollow" class="link">Brian Olsen</a> contributed the initial implementation of the <code>runcell</code> command; and <a href="https://github.com/CAM-Gerlach" rel="nofollow" class="link">CAM Gerlach</a> made significant improvements to our documentation.
<a href="https://github.com/goanpeca/" rel="nofollow" class="link">Gonzalo Peña-Castellanos</a> helped us to greatly improve the user experience of code completion and linting in the editor, implemented most of the enhancements to the Files pane, and refactored and improved our configuration system; <a href="https://github.com/andfoy" rel="nofollow" class="link">Edgar Margffoy</a> single-handedly created a client to support the same <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/" rel="nofollow" class="link">protocol</a> used by VSCode to provide completion and linting for lots of programming languages, added code snippet completions and vastly improved code folding in the editor; <a href="https://github.com/dalthviz" rel="nofollow" class="link">Daniel Althviz</a> developed the necessary infrastructure to install and use Kite smoothly within Spyder, and added the new object viewer to the Variable Explorer.
Finally, our junior developers, <a href="https://github.com/steff456" rel="nofollow" class="link">Stephannie Jimenez</a> and <a href="https://github.com/juanis2112" rel="nofollow" class="link">Juanita Gomez</a>, although still finding their way around our complex codebase, managed to make important contributions, such as improving the icons we use per file type in Files (Juanita), and allowing users to run code in an external system terminal on macOS (Stephannie).`,G,S,Te=`I hope you all enjoy the results of this massive effort!

In <a href="https://www.spyder-ide.org/blog/reusable-research-bof-scipy-2023/" rel="nofollow" class="link">Part 1 of this two-part series</a>, we went over our motivation and goals for the session and the challenges that attendees brought up.
Now, we’ll review the tips, strategies, tools and platforms (including Spyder!) that participants shared as ways to address these obstacles.
We’d again like to thank <a href="https://cfp.scipy.org/2023/speaker/SE7SNC/" rel="nofollow" class="link">Juanita Gomez</a> for helping organize the BoF, Hari for his hard work compiling a summary of the outcomes, and everyone for attending and sharing such great ideas and insights!`,p,d,a="Making notebooks more reusable",u,c,de=`As far as reproducibility is concerned, it was brought up that it can be difficult to easily compare outputs between notebooks created by different researchers.
In response, one participant mentioned that VSCode recently made <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks#_custom-notebook-diffing" rel="nofollow" class="link">an improvement</a> to the notebook diff viewers to more easily show just the code changes.
However, users stressed that it was critical to be able to diff the actual notebook output, not just its contents, and expressed a desire for a tool to cover that aspect.`,Q,w,ye=`In response to these concerns, others responded that notebooks should not be considered a unit of reproducible research, which should instead be a complete software project, including notebooks or scripts, an environment/requirements file and a record of commands to run there.
They recommended the <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/blog/8-levels-of-reproducibility" rel="nofollow" class="link">8-levels of Reproducibility</a> and <a href="https://github.com/conda-incubator/conda-project" rel="nofollow" class="link">Conda Project</a> to help guide and implement this.`,V,b,ce=`Additionally, attendees recommended <a href="https://papermill.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" rel="nofollow" class="link">Papermill</a>, describing it as a very useful tool for parameterizing and executing notebooks programmatically.
Others suggested <a href="https://containers.dev/" rel="nofollow" class="link">Devcontainers</a>, to allow collaborating with a lab group or team in a shared environment and seeing everything on their screen, as well as <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/learn/collaboration/live-share" rel="nofollow" class="link">Live Share in VSCode</a>.`,C,x,ke=`Participants also expressed frustration that despite notebooks being intended to make programming more literate, this often does not happen in practice.
Beginners like the interactivity in notebooks because they don’t know how to use more advanced programming tools, but they don’t always take advantage of their readability features.
To address this, attendees stressed the importance of getting users accustomed to best practices that can also be helpful for reproducibility.
A participant mentioned a <code>nbflake8</code> tool to lint notebooks, though it could not be easily found online, and others wished for a <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/1218" rel="nofollow" class="link">Ruff implementation</a> (which at the time of this writing is <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/5188" rel="nofollow" class="link">now complete</a>).`,oe,T,fe="Migrating notebooks to modules",ie,_,se=`As one participant put it, “I love notebooks, and also love modules, and love the flow of code from notebooks into modules once it approaches that point.”
They went on to describe modules as a key unit of documented, tested code, but which doesn’t mean a lot on its own, whereas combined with a notebook, it gives them context and meaning.
For communities that may be afraid of modules, the participant recommended trying to make creating and transitioning to them easier, so users have fully importable, reusable Python code.
For students, notebooks often turn into a fancy scratch pad or script file, and once they get stuff that works, they can move that stuff out into modules, and then the notebooks start to morph into examples and the history of what the work was about that can be interpreted by other researchers.`,G,S,Te=`Other attendees chimed in with similar stories, with a NIST researcher mentioning this is an area they’d been working on for 10 years, with their approach being putting the stuff they want to be modular in a regular Python module, and then have a Jupyter notebook that shows an example using the code, such as in their <a href="https://github.com/usnistgov/iprPy" rel="nofollow" class="link">IPRPy project</a>.
To aid this process, participants suggested tools like the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=njpwerner.autodocstring" rel="nofollow" class="link">Autodocstring extension in VSCode</a> and the docstring generator built into <a href="https://docs.spyder-ide.org/current/panes/editor.html" rel="nofollow" class="link">Spyder’s editor</a> as great ways to reduce the friction for students when writing documentation, as they just add the triple quotes and the IDE generates a pre-filled docstring for them.`,O,M,Se=`An important reproducibility and reusability tool many cited for this was <a href="https://github.com/fastai/nbdev" rel="nofollow" class="link">nbdev</a>, which can allow users to develop their code and let it grow, and then eventually export the parts as modules at the end.
According to attendees, its documentation mostly talks about everything as packages, but it can also be used for individual notebooks and modules.
Some participants were initially hesitant to show it to their students since they’re early Python programmers, but it was actually quite easy for them, only requiring as little as one line of code at the end.
(Unfortunately as of this writing, it seems ndbdev development <a href="https://hamel.dev/blog/posts/nbdev/" rel="nofollow" class="link">has stalled</a> due to its expected commercial opportunities not materializing.)
Others asked for more documentation resources for this, since they were still learning Python themselves and would like to learn more about this and teach it to their students.
In addition to this very blog post and guide, one attendee brought up that they did <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7zS8Ld4_iA" rel="nofollow" class="link">a tutorial on that topic at SciPy</a>, adding that the documentation is pretty intimidating but it would be great to have something more focused on smaller-scale usage.`,P,m,be=`As additional approaches, attendees mentioned they have their students use <a href="https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/" rel="nofollow" class="link">Jupytext</a>, which helps the student to convert notebooks to Python files that can be committed to a Git repository.
This allows the code to be committed as a Python file, while allowing Jupyter to open it as a notebook and continue working on it.
Others brought up <a href="https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html" rel="nofollow" class="link">nb-convert</a>, a command line tool that can convert notebooks to many different formats including a Python script, which is integrated into IDEs like Spyder, and that there is also a <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks#_export-your-jupyter-notebook" rel="nofollow" class="link">similar VSCode feature</a>.`,me,B,Ie="Enabling reusable Python packages",pe,K,je=`When it comes to overall workflow, all agreed that going from a script or notebook to a reusable, installable Python package could be a major challenge, especially for students and non-programmers.
Attendees from NASA mentioned that for their projects everything has to be documented, and one of the things they’ve struggled with was converting a notebook to the type of report NASA is typically looking for.
Others described their workflow being as simple and “old school” as writing a <code>aaa_readme.txt</code> file where they record a diary of what they were doing on that project so if they have a break working on it, they can go back to those notes and remind themselves.`,W,z,Ae=`To help address this, participants recommended a “really cool” <a href="https://github.com/showyourwork/showyourwork" rel="nofollow" class="link">tool called “Show Your Work”</a> that comes out of the astrophysics community, which is primarily aimed at producing a paper at the end but also a Python package, and includes all the steps that show users’ work along the way.
It is built around a tool called <a href="https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/" rel="nofollow" class="link">Snakemake</a>, which then sets up a template for both the Python package and the paper.
Additionally, attendees described it as having a “really helpful” guide for getting started and ensuring all of a user’s projects have the same structure.
It was brought up that Azel Donath, maintainer of Gammapy and speaker at SciPy 2023, published <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13584" rel="nofollow" class="link">their Gammapy paper</a> by <a href="https://github.com/gammapy/gammapy-v1.0-paper" rel="nofollow" class="link">using this tool</a>.`,R,D,Ue=`As a followup, participants asked how this differed from <a href="https://quarto.org/" rel="nofollow" class="link">Quarto</a>, to which the response was that Quarto is much more general, whereas Show Your Work was specifically built to allow users to produce a PDF in LaTeX at the end.
Others mentioned <a href="https://github.com/duecredit/duecredit/" rel="nofollow" class="link">Duecredit</a>, a related tool for citing open source authors which looks at code and finds the authors (via Git commits) that wrote it.`,ge,ne,Ne=`Additionally, users expressed particular appreciation for the <a href="https://github.com/scientific-python/cookie" rel="nofollow" class="link">Cookiecutter template</a> that <a href="https://iscinumpy.dev/" rel="nofollow" class="link">Henry Schreiner III</a> has for packaging.
They mentioned that a lot of their workflows are just messing around with their data, and having something like a package structure from the get go helps make it easier to not miss things.
As a followup, a nuclear engineer mentioned they often have two week projects leveraging Jupyter at their center, with a cookiecutter template that has Sphinx, and a directory structure, and metadata that looks familiar and has everything set up by default.

As Spyder was, is and always will be a community-developed and supported IDE, this was far from a mortal blow to the project, but it did impact the pace and breadth of development.
Developer effort previously spent on our Spyder plugins, like <a href="https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder-notebook" rel="nofollow" class="link">spyder-notebook</a>, <a href="https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder-reports" rel="nofollow" class="link">spyder-reports</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder-terminal" rel="nofollow" class="link">spyder-terminal</a>, among others, was refocused on the Spyder core, and the development and release of Spyder 4 was put mostly on hold.
To help make up for the loss of funding, we appealed to the community for support, asking users who found Spyder valuable to back our project on <a href="https://opencollective.com/spyder" rel="nofollow" class="link">OpenCollective</a>, in order to accelerate development and fund more features for Spyder 4.`,V,b,ce='<img src="spyder_opencollective.png" alt="Spyder OpenCollective, showing many donations and backers"/><figcaption>Spyder OpenCollective, showing many donations and backers</figcaption>',C,x,ke=`To our unending gratitude, you responded! In the few months since then, we’ve gone from zero to a budget of well over $4500 per year and rising at an increasing pace, thanks to the continuing contributions of over 80 (and counting!) individual and institutional backers.
We also had several new core team members and community contributors pitch in to help carry the load, and we’ve got some more great news in the very next post on the funding front.
While we’ve got a ways to go to match the level of funding we’ve received under Anaconda, your support has helped make possible several of the new features we’ve planned for Spyder 4, and allow us to commit to releasing it much sooner than we would be able to otherwise.
Your generous donations go directly toward funding the Spyder community’s most-requested new and improved features for Spyder 4, so keep them coming!
Stay tuned; we are considering rolling out new donation tiers and rewards at some point soon so you won’t want to miss that.`,oe,T,fe="Development by the Numbers",ie,_,se=`On the development side of the project, while our overall pace is modestly lower than its peak under our Anaconda funding, we’ve been quite active fixing bugs and adding new features and enhancements over the past six months.

Users have opened over 1375 issues (bugs, feature requests and other feedback), of which we’ve managed to resolve more than 1330, or nearly 97%.`,G,S,Te='<img src="github_commit_history.png" alt="Github commit timeseries for Spyder, with high activity over the past few years"/><figcaption>Github commit timeseries for Spyder, with high activity over the past few years</figcaption>',O,M,Se=`Further, over 250 pull requests from almost two dozen unique contributors, some old, some new, have been submitted since that time—fixing bugs, adding new or enhanced functionality, or making other improvements—of which 226 have been merged to the main Spyder codebase.
This work has coalesced into four separate official releases during that period, with another only days away.

Over those same past six months, alongside hundreds of bugfixes and minor enhancements, we’ve made multiple significant improvements to the Spyder 3 Editor, IPython Console, Variable Explorer, and Find in Files tool, along with a number of others under the hood and to the application as a whole.
Even better, the majority of these were suggested by you, our users, and some of you even pitched in to help implement them.`,pe,K,je=`Especially since you will probably be spending most of your time in it, we added a several new commands and functions to the <strong>Editor</strong> that will hopefully make your life easier, each with corresponding customizable shortcuts for easier access.
You can now insert a new line below the current one regardless of the cursor’s current position with <code>Ctrl-Shift-Enter</code>, and you can now use <code>Shift-Delete</code> to cut selected text, and <code>Shift-Insert</code> to paste it.
<code>Ctrl-PageUp</code>, <code>Ctrl-PageDown</code>, and <code>Ctrl-Tab</code> shortcuts are all now fully configurable.
Finally, you can now easily <code>Tab</code> from the <code>Find</code> to the <code>Replace</code> box when open, and better yet your <code>Find</code> text is automatically copied to the <code>Replace</code> box to make modifications easier.`,W,z,Ae=`Second only to the Editor in terms of them most critical Spyder components, the <strong>IPython Console</strong> also got a lot of love in recent releases.
We’ve made several improvements to significantly improve the startup time, and added an optional feature to show the elapsed time each kernel has been running.
You can now remove all user-defined variables with a GUI command, and changes in <code>import</code>ed modules now take effect instantly and automatically in the console, without even a re-<code>import</code> needed.
<code>Cloudpickle</code> is now used to serialize objects from the Console to the Variable Explorer, greatly improving the latter’s capabilities (as discussed below).
Finally, Cython files are now automatically run in dedicated Cython consoles, and you can now use the edit magic command from the Console to open any file right inside Spyder’s Editor.`,R,D,Ue='<img src="varexp_array_display.png" alt="Variable Explorer, with a variety of array types displayed"/><figcaption>Variable Explorer, with a variety of array types displayed</figcaption>',ge,ne,Ne=`The <strong>Variable Explorer</strong>, which many of you cite as Spyder’s “killer feature”, has greatly improved as well.
Most notably, thanks to the aforementioned <code>cloudpickle</code> change, you now have access to rich, deep exploration of nearly any object, builtin or custom, and can traverse, view, and when possible even edit complex hierarchies of nested types with ease.
The Variable Explorer now fully supports <code>Timedelta</code> objects, both built-in and <code>Pandas</code> variants, allowing you to easily view and edit them just like <code>datetime</code> and <code>Timestamp</code>.
It also now uses a “pretty”, more human-readable format for dates, times, timedeltas and the like, and also now supports displaying a much wider range of <code>Numpy</code> array types.
As a quality of life change, it has much better handling of immutable types, like <code>tuples</code>, clearly showing they can’t be edited upfront and avoiding bothersome errors when trying to do so.`,xe,X,Re=`Rounding out the major changes, the <strong>Find in Files</strong> tool now allows you to remove items from the <code>Search In</code> list by hovering over them and pressing <code>Delete</code>, and there’s also a new option to clear all recent directories.
Under the hood, we’ve made <code>PyQt5</code> a dependency for easier, one-command installation and added many more tests and better project infrastructure to help catch errors.
To make things easier on you if something does go wrong, we’ve greatly improved the error reporting system, the UI/UX and the explanatory text to be more up to date, informative, and user friendly.`,_e,Z,We='<img src="error_report_dialog.png" alt="New Spyder error report dialog, with more helpful UI text"/><figcaption>New Spyder error report dialog, with more helpful UI text</figcaption>',g,L,Ve=`All of the mentioned additions are included in the latest released version of Spyder, 3.2.8, which you can update to with <code>conda update spyder</code> (if using Anaconda), with your package manager/distribution (if installed that way) or with <code>pip update spyder</code> (otherwise).
Even more are already implemented for our next release, due out in a week’s time, and we’ll have a preview of what to expect right here on the blog even sooner.`,U,J,Ze="Affiliated Project Progress",N,Y,Ye=`Outside the core Spyder IDE, while most plugins have been paused until the Spyder 4 release, work on other affiliated projects has continued.

Most importantly, we are proud to report that since this January Jupyter Notebook (in 5.3.0) and JupyterLab have both adopted it to create and manage system terminals on Windows!
The <a href="https://github.com/spyder-ide/qtsass" rel="nofollow" class="link">qtsass</a> SASS to Qt stylesheet compiler has a new maintainer, with development including new dev infrastructure, refactoring work, a PyPI release, and new features, with more on the way.
Finally, our <a href="https://github.com/spyder-ide/loghub" rel="nofollow" class="link">loghub</a> automatic changelog generator has seen significant internal and external developer interest, as well as three releases, bug fixes, additional examples, and the ability to group issues and PRs together if desired.

NumFOCUS is a nonprofit dedicated to supporting <a href="https://www.numfocus.org/sponsored-projects" rel="nofollow" class="link">key scientific computing projects</a>; <a href="https://www.numfocus.org/programs/sustainability" rel="nofollow" class="link">promoting sustainability</a> in the open source ecosystem; educating the next generation of scientists, engineers, developers and data analysts through their flagship <a href="https://www.numfocus.org/programs/pydata" rel="nofollow" class="link">PyData</a> program; and enabling and inspiring the next generation through their <a href="https://www.numfocus.org/programs/grants-sponsored-events" rel="nofollow" class="link">grants, scholarships</a> and <a href="https://www.numfocus.org/programs/john-hunter-technology-fellowship" rel="nofollow" class="link">fellowships</a>, <a href="https://www.numfocus.org/programs/diversity-inclusion" rel="nofollow" class="link">diversity and inclusion program</a>, and involvement in the <a href="https://www.numfocus.org/programs/google-summer-code" rel="nofollow" class="link">Google Summer of Code</a>.`,Q,w,ye=`We applied for the funding back in March of this year, along with many other scientific Python projects, and were one of the fortunate projects selected after the review process.
The award runs from May through this November, and will enable multiple betas with new features to be released throughout 2018, with the first feature-complete release candidate of Spyder 4 planned by the year’s end (we’ll have more detail on all that in Part 3).

The father of much of the modern PyData ecosystem including NumPy, SciPy and Numba, Travis has been instrumental in the dramatic growth of open-source data analysis with Python through founding or helping lead Enthought, Continuum/Anaconda, NumFOCUS, and more.
Quansight, Travis’ newest venture, focuses on scaling up the PyData ecosystem to solve even larger and more integrated problems, connecting companies with the open-source tools that can benefit their business, and helping build a more robust ecosystem for open-source scientific development.`,oe,T,fe=`As part of that mission, Carlos was hired through at least the end of 2018 to help make several open-source projects more sustainable in the long run, and I’m sure you all will be happy to hear that one of them will be our very own Spyder!
After previously helping support the project over at Anaconda, Travis and Quansight will fund Carlos to work part-time on Spyder development, helping the project continue to grow and evolve, and keeping Spyder 4 moving along at a faster pace.
Congratulations Carlos, and thanks to Travis and Quansight!`,ie,_,se=`Aside from those two, we also have several other potential long-term funding opportunities in the pipeline.
Stay tuned to hear more about those in the coming months.`,G,S,Te="Spyder 3.3.0 Ready to Go",O,M,Se=`Meanwhile, on the development side of things, we’ve just finished the rollout of the next update in the stable Spyder 3 line, 3.3.0, and will have a full post shortly going over the changes and enhancements in detail.
In brief, it has some significant under the hood revisions, cleaning house of some old end of life dependencies and legacy support (Python 3.3 and PyQt4 below 5.5), and separates the IPython Console kernel code into a new <code>spyder-kernels</code> package to make it easier for you to work with different Python environments and remote sessions, and easier for us to add exciting new features down the road.
Additionally, it adds new preferences options for console plotting and autocompletion, improves the usability and performance of Variable Explorer object viewers, includes a new, fully automated error reporting feature to make submitting reports faster, easier and more helpful, and contains a number of other minor improvements and usability enhancements, along with numerous bug fixes.`,P,m,be='<img src="spyder-remote-kernel.png" alt="A remote kernel running in a system console alongside Spyder&#39;s connect to kernel dialog"/><figcaption>A remote kernel running in a system console alongside Spyder&#39;s connect to kernel dialog</figcaption>',me,B,Ie="Spyder 4 Public Beta 1 on Deck",pe,K,je=`We’ll also be releasing the first public beta of Spyder 4 in the very near future, to allow users and developers to get their hands on the next generation of the IDE and start using and testing it as soon as possible.
There are far too many significant new features to list here, and they are more than worthy of their own full-length post, as there are many substantial changes to the Editor, Console, Variable Explorer, File Explorer, Outline Explorer, API and more.`,W,z,Ae='<img src="spyder-4b1-preview-editor.png" alt="Preview of the new Spyder 4 Editor, showing several of the mentioned features"/><figcaption>Preview of the new Spyder 4 Editor, showing several of the mentioned features</figcaption>',R,D,Ue=`Some of the major highlights in the Editor include code folding, indentation guides, multiple line length indicators, a live class/method/function panel (<em>a la</em> Visual Studio), many more shortcut commands, better comment/uncomment, and more.
The IPython Console gains the ability to start specialized Pylab, SymPy, and Cython consoles, and the Variable Explorer gets MultiIndex support, now natively handles all Pandas indexers, and can display sets in a dedicated GUI editor.
Meanwhile, the File Explorer now has multi-select functionality and can open any file with the user’s OS-configured external default program, while the outline explorer can now group items by cell, and in multiple levels.
Finally, Spyder 4 exposes a public API for external plugins, offers more language translations, features several global UI improvements and has numerous under the hood and refactoring changes, and countless other enhancements big and small.
It’s the future of Spyder, so if you’d like to get a taste of the cutting edge,  we’d love for you to try it when it drops and let us know what you think!`,ge,ne,Ne="Spyder Documentation, Reborn",xe,X,Re=`Aside from Spyder 3 and 4, we’ve got another big ticket item for you all in the next few days: our brand new docs!
We’ve been working on a major overhaul of our documentation, which will saw its first official release with Spyder 3.3.0.

We’ve greatly expanded many pages and sections and adding new ones, updated outdated references, performed an exhaustive copyedit over nearly every line of the text, developed and implemented a consistent style guide, transitioned to a modern theme with our own custom CSS extensions, added or replaced many  dozens of high-resolution screenshots, modified the source code and infrastructure to be easier to develop, build and maintain, and much more.
Even better, you can expect even more improvements in the coming months, as we further expand them toward the standard you’d expect for a feature-rich, multifaceted application like Spyder.

This was the first reason why I got interested in this project.
For me, documentation is just a fancy way of saying “educating people on using software”.
The challenge here was not recording and editing the videos (which was actually a pretty arduous task), or planning the content for them; the real challenge was to make an impact in such a way that users could find documentation actually useful.`,oe,T,fe=`When users start to use a new IDE, or any new software, they usually refer to its documentation, which sometimes doesn’t give enough tools for them to start from zero.

However, if I’m a completely new user and I don’t even know how to open it, where do I start?`,ie,_,se=`I planned these videos as a series of progressive steps that can get users from zero experience to actually working with Spyder.

The <a href="https://youtu.be/E2Dap5SfXkI" rel="nofollow" class="link">first tutorial</a> covers different ways of opening Spyder, the basics of using its interface and an introduction to its four main panes, along with a quick look at the others so that users can get familiar with how Spyder is organized.`,O,M,Se=`In the <a href="https://youtu.be/WV9bm4ey7Cg" rel="nofollow" class="link">second video</a>, users can learn the basics of using Spyder’s four main panes.

They should be able to interact with the Variable Explorer to browse and edit the objects in the console, and use the Help pane to get documentation in two different ways.`,P,m,be=`The <a href="https://youtu.be/-dARZBUDk_s" rel="nofollow" class="link">third video</a> is meant to show users how to customize Spyder’s interface to start working with it in the way they feel more comfortable according to their preferences.

Usually being a developer makes it hard to put yourself in the position of a user and understand exactly what a user needs.
