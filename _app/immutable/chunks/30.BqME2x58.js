It is a pleasure for us on the Spyder team to work every day to improve the workflow of developers, scientists, engineers and data analysts.
We are very glad to receive and share a STX Next testimonial about Spyder, along with an interview with one of their developers, <a href="https://github.com/Michael-Wisniewski" rel="nofollow" class="link">Michael Wiśniewski</a>, who has found Spyder very useful in his job.`,p,h,a,u,c,re="What Michael Wiśniewski says about Spyder",O,v,fe=`In an era of a continuously growing demand for analysis of vast amounts of data, we are facing increasingly complex tasks to perform.
Sure, we are not alone—there are many great tools designed for scientists and data analysts.
We have NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, and others.
But, wouldn’t it be nice to have one extra tool that could combine all the required packages into one compact working environment? Asking this question is precisely how my journey with Spyder began.`,F,x,he=`In my opinion, Spyder is the go-to-solution that helps to speed up the data analysis processes.
For me, the biggest strength of this IDE is that it has all the benefits of Matlab/RStudio and makes them available to the Pythonista community.
It provides us with an easy-to-organize workspace that accommodates code, visualizations and shell in just one window.
Besides, the pane called variable explorer allows direct access to all data placed in the memory.`,L,k,ue=`Another cool feature is the tool’s integration with Jupyter notebooks.
Just open and browse different notebooks without thinking about server-side and file paths.
Want to run a single line of code or quickly check a chart update? IPython is on board and ready by default.`,J,P,pe="Michael Wiśniewski’s interview",q,C,ae,$,S,Se=`<em>I’m Michael Wiśniewski and I’ve been working at STX Next as a full-stack developer for over a year.
During this time, I was involved in various projects from many different areas—from typical web applications where I used Python and JavaScript to implementing ML solutions for image recognition on the nVidia Jetson platform.
After hours, my colleagues and I run a machine learning community of practice. Today, I’d like to share my thoughts on using Spyder.</em>`,U,T,Me="<em>How long have you been using Spyder?</em>",M,b,be="I discovered Spyder around a year ago, at the time it was transitioning from version 3 to the current one.",ce,W,je="<em>How many people in your company use Spyder?</em>",ne,X,De=`In my department, three of my colleagues use Spyder on a daily basis.
Some of them use it for commercial projects, while others use it for personal research.
The number is growing, since most people try Spyder out after their first contact with it.`,K,N,We="<em>What kind of projects have you done using Spyder?</em>",V,R,Ne=`I’ve found applications for Spyder in many different areas.
One time, I used it for a project that relied on machine learning algorithms to assess risk based on documents provided by a user.
Since Spyder aggregates out-of-the-box the most <a href="https://www.stxnext.com/blog/most-popular-python-scientific-libraries/" rel="nofollow" class="link">popular scientific Python packages</a>, it was used during the whole development process, from data pre-processing and visualization to assessment of the final solution.`,ve,ie,Ke=`Another time, Spyder proved to be very helpful in a project involving the analysis of ancient religious texts.
The task was to create a script that would check file integrity and the correctness of the texts themselves.
Because of the large size of the data sets, the script had to be efficient and able to handle a lot of edge cases.
A built-in ipdb debugger and script profiler (together with the Spyder-memory-profiler plugin) was very helpful in achieving this goal.`,Pe,le,Ve=`To me, this IDE is also a great tool for conducting workshops.
The ability to discuss algorithms while visualizing their results in a separate plot panel, without the need to switch windows, greatly facilitates presentations.`,Te,se,Je="<em>What are the Spyder features that you like the most?</em>",_,H,Ye=`One of my personal favorites is the Variable Explorer and its integration withJupyter notebooks through the Spyder-notebook plugin.

It saves time and helps me to stay focused longer.`,B,oe,lt=`The great thing about Spyder is that it allows you to compare several solutions side by side.
We can easily test several sets of given parameter values and examine how that affects a given function by observing charts.`,qe,Ie,at=`Interactive window tools often simplify and speed up code analysis.
For example, checking class inheritance via the new object explorer is clearer and immediately gives more information than when doing it through the editor.`,Oe,Le,st="<em>What features would you like to see in the future in Spyder?</em>",Fe,He,it=`Possibly further integration with Git services would be a good idea.

We mentioned that we are currently working with GitHub and others about a potential optional integration in Spyder, specialized for scientific tasks.`,U,T,Me=`One participant shared that their large scientific organization was very reticent to use Jupyter AI because it was effectively a blackbox, and they needed to be able to show where their code comes from.
They expressed the desire for an AI that generates citations, to help address this issue.
Responding to their question of whether others were interested in the same, attendees stated that they’d still need to go and verify the generated citation, and were unsure it would save them much time overall.
Another participant added that more so than citations for code, the most important thing AI would help with is tests that verify that the code does what it is supposed to do.
Others agreed, saying that AI tend to do much better iterating on existing code than writing brand new code, and recommended that people try asking LLMs to write tests for existing code and examining the results.
They also found that AIs tend to do much better on code that has proper variable names and literate structure, which is certainly a benefit to everyone but very much not always found in scientific scripts.`,M,b,be="Overall, attitudes in the room toward LLMs and generative AI varied quite a bit, but there was a general consensus that while scientists were open to considering the technology as an aid, it had to be reasonably correct and verifiable, which is a rather difficult challenge for the current AI state of the art.",ce,W,je="Interactive computation with diverse data types",ne,X,De="Another common theme was a desire for scientific IDEs to allow users to visualize and interact with more of the diverse array of data types and structures used in scientific computation.",K,N,We=`One participant in the geospatial field mentioned that interactivity with these data is limited with IDEs, and that they generally like notebooks but there are workflows where an IDE would be nice.
THey also expressed a desire for IDEs having native support for interactive map displays like in QGIS or ArcGIS rather than just static Matplolib images, which would make for more rapid prototyping.`,V,R,Ne=`Another attendee shared their focus on using dataframes and other rich data structures backed by a database instead of instead of just plain CSVs, asking if IDEs can add a “database browser” instead of just a way to view a single Pandas table.
They described how their data lives in databases, possibly remote or in the cloud, rather than flat files on their filesystem, and have made this the norm at their institution.
Their solution supports any database type that pandas does, with the simplest interface to it, so it feels like a CSV file, and would like IDEs to support that workflow.
In response, an audience member following on Slack mentioned that Ibis covers a lot of territory for exploring tabular data in many different data storage backends, and this might be a path to database exploration in IDEs.`,ve,ie,Ke=`Other participants shared their challenges when debugging large datasets, saying this led to slow stepping through the code (of around 30 seconds per step) when a very large variable needs to be refetched at every step.
This, they related, resulted from a lack of a facility to do “lazy data loading” in Python; everything needs a wrapper.
They’d like to see a streaming wrapper plugin that data types can implement lazy loading in, which could be then used in all IDEs and notebooks.
In response, other attendees mentioned that the main challenge here was creating a way to indicate to consumers that data is expensive to generate a <code>repr</code>, which is where the costs really come in.`,Pe,le,Ve=`Finally, a PyCharm user shared how the xarray/pandas data types and their extension systems and data accessors were all opaque to that IDE’s autocomplete, at least without further tagging or augmentation in the IDE or the code.
They expressed that to address this, IDEs should be better aware of extensions such as these.
Others, including ourselves, mentioned in response that using customizable LSP servers can help make editors better aware of extensible syntaxes like this, which is indeed what Spyder and other IDEs do (and the Spyder team maintains the <a href="https://github.com/python-lsp/python-lsp-server" rel="nofollow" class="link">de-facto standard pluggable Python implementation of</a>).`,Te,se,Je="While user needs here varied, there was a clear theme that users greatly value being able to interactively view, edit and analyze a diverse array of data types right within their IDE, as Spyder continues to particularly focus on.",_,H,Ye="Desktop vs web-based IDEs",Q,Y,Xe="A popular point of discussion was the merits of desktop versus web-based interfaces and IDEs for science research, which saw some mixed opinions on the topic.",Z,ee,et=`Posing the question directly, we asked people to share their opinions on a web-based vs. desktop applications, and on a true desktop programs versus those just with a webview as a UI.
One participant stated that a web browser can help them be effective for collaboration, but may not be as useful for single-user situations as a native application would be.
Another had concerns with the usability of Zoom screen sharing, as sharing a desktop application just shared that application, while sharing a web-based IDE shared the user’s entire web browser.
A third suggested <a href="https://vscode.dev/" rel="nofollow" class="link">vscode.dev</a>, which runs in a browser and which can be self-hosted, but stated that Python support is not “fully on par” with the desktop version.
A final point discussed was the possibility of running desktop IDEs inside a web-based container to improve security and ease of deployment, particularly using Python’s new WASM support.`,ze,ge,tt=`On a related note, an attendee shared that they support a small statistics group, and their biggest challenge is helping students learn scientific computing.
They have a rather “rugged individualist culture”, and feel they need to learn how to share knowledge with others, asking the audience how they could accomplish that with IDEs.
This prompted others to relate how, where they work, platforms for accessing data require a lot of authentication.
This entails using JupyterHub as their default IDE/platform, with very little flexibility in the matter.
They would like a platform for other IDEs to be able to connect to a shared JupyterHub environment, which is exactly what we are working on for Spyder 6.1 and beyond.`,Ge,me,nt="GPU compute integration",B,oe,lt=`One fairly specific topic that got a disproportionate amount of attention was incorporating better support for GPU computing (e.g. CUDA) within IDEs and interfaces, thanks to Nvidia representatives in the room posing the initial question.
They stated that Nvidia was “getting serious” about Python and CUDA, and they would love to “hear people’s gripes about developing GPU apps in Python, what tooling you use and what problems you face and how do you debug them”.
They also asked for people’s experiences working in Python together with native code (C++).`,qe,Ie,at=`Responding first to the question on native code, one participant described how they had to compile a Fortran module and import it from Python.
They just used <code>f2py</code> and the workflow was already in there and worked: they’d change the native code, recompile and rinse and repeat.
However, they said it would be nice to offer a workflow to shorten that development loop.
It was mentioned that this was particularly a problem with two separate codebases, where changes in one can affect the other, which is difficult to conceptualize and work with the coupling between them.
The Nvidia representatives then asked them how they would like to have a debugger with the ability to step into their code from Python to Fortran but still able to inspect your variables on the Python side, to which they replied “Sounds awesome!“.`,Oe,Le,st=`Another attendee supervises a postdoc using a bunch of A100 GPUs, and asked the postdoc how he knew he was getting the most performance out of it.
The postdoc’s reply, which the attendee found rather telling, was that “PyTorch [just] runs”: it was painful enough for them to just get it running. so they were not particularly interested in spending even more time optimizing it further.
The participant now has new students doing JAX and expect the same thing to happen, since diving into hardware level optimization is something that students really won’t do and can be very intimidating.
They have students who don’t know how to use the 4 CPUs in their laptop, much less the GPUs in a supercomputer center.
When asked what they feel is the main problem causing this, such as documentation or tooling, the researcher replied it was courage on the student’s part to actually “go down there” and dig into the low-level code.
The postdoc clearly likes the platform and bought 40 new A100s, and is fine with the platform abstracting that for him.
However, the attendee expressed concern that this poses a real sociological challenge to get students used to using—much less optimizing—GPUs.`,Fe,He,it=`Finally, it was asked what IDEs could do to make GPU workflows more convenient.
In reply, participants suggested better integration with NVSMI or an integrated dashboard of GPU usage, which would allow users to see that, for instance, a particular kernel crunching data is too big to use the full potential of the GPU.
The Nvidia folks mentioned that they do have a profiling tool that could potentially address some of those concerns, gives visibility on GPU utilization, bottlenecks and efficiency, and for interested folks to follow up with them directly.
In response to people asking about support for such tools in a VSCode extension, they shared that these tools have their own UI but could explore IDE integration.
They mentioned that tooling in Python tends to be “pretty thin” as users often don’t go looking for tools and use the ones that are there, whereas their profiler can be really intimidating and throws a lot of information at such users, potentially putting them off.`,D,te,dt=`All told, there was a surprising amount of interest and discussion around this once-niche topic, signaling that GPU computing has become something much closer to a mainstream need in the scientific space.
Thus, while the discussion is of course of most interest to GPU companies like Nvidia, it suggests an IDE plugin to support this profiling tooling and other GPU integration features might be of significant benefit to the wider user community.`,Re,Ae,rt="Spyder feedback",Ze,Ee,ot=`While most of the discussion focused on topics applicable to broader categories of IDEs, there were a few specific bits of Spyder feedback.
In particular, attendees praised Spyder’s plotting functionality, though some expressed a preference for the non-default mode of displaying plots in separate windows over the Plots pane.
Others mentioned that the one killer feature for them that it was missing was multi-line editing, a common request over the years and something we plan to work on for forthcoming Spyder versions, along with support for collaborative editing.`,w,j,ht=`A particularly salient comment was one of the attendees’ request that “We need RStudio for Python”, with another replying that Spyder fills most of that gap.
Perhaps the main RStudio feature not built in is Quarto/RMarkdown, though we are currently exploring the possibility of helping develop a plugin supporting that.
Other comments, such as a desire for GitHub Copilot, better data exploration and visualization capabilities, and support for connecting to remote JupyterHub instances, are also features we already offer or are developing or exploring.`,ut,Ue,pt="Next steps",A,de,ft=`Overall, the broader learnings gained here for IDE and interface developers were perhaps less in the detailed specifics of each comment, but rather the common themes users focused the most on.
Perhaps the least surprising was interest in generative AI, suggesting that IDE developers should continue to explore integration possibilities, but keeping a critical eye while doing so.
By contrast, the most surprising was the extensive discussion about GPU computing and how IDEs and tools can help with that, which seems to indicate that IDE plugins for assisting in this regard might be valuable.`,m,y,_e=`Another area of user emphasis was the importance of interactive data exploration for a variety of formats and structures.
While a subset of such could be built into an IDE (as we have with Spyder’s Variable Explorer), given the diversity of scientific data types across fields this suggests the need for a more pluggable/extensible approach to variable exploration.
Finally, the consensus was unresolved on desktop versus web-based IDEs, though participants did identify a need for a common framework to connect local IDEs to remote platforms like JupyterHub.
To that end, we’re working to provide those facilities in Spyder 6.1, and could eventually be developed into such an common interface.`,St,Mt,$t=`Thanks to everyone for attending and sharing such great ideas and insights, and we look forward to continuing to learn from the community and hear more in the future.

One thing the Variable Explorer is missing is the ability to display the value of arbitrary, user-definable expressions while debugging.
For example, it might be useful to see the value of a specific attribute of an object, or the value of an array at some index.

Two of the biggest changes—user-selectable syntax highlighting themes, and enhanced external editor/IDE integration—are already built right into Spyder, so they’ll likely be of more interest if you use QtConsole standalone or with another editor/IDE.
However, most of the other changes should prove quite useful within Spyder as well, and many were in fact suggested and even implemented by users of our IDE.
Particular highlights include a block indent/unindent feature, Select-All (<code>Ctrl-Shift-A</code>) being made cell-specific, <code>Ctrl-Backspace</code> and <code>Ctrl-Delete</code> behaving more intelligently across whitespace and line boundaries, <code>Ctrl-D</code> allowing you to easily exit <code>ipdb</code>, <code>input()</code> and the like, and numerous smaller enhancements and bug fixes.

There’s also a brand-new error reporting process, new options in the IPython console, usability and performance improvements for the Variable Explorer, multiple new and changed dependency requirements and more, so there’s plenty to go over.
Finally, we’d like to briefly share a few final notes on this release and the latest on our plans going forward.`,u,c,re="Modular, flexible Console architecture",O,v,fe=`The biggest single change with version 3.3.0/3.3.1 is a major overhaul of how IPython Consoles are started and managed in Spyder.

While the most dramatic differences are under the hood, there’s plenty for everyone to like (and a few things to be aware of).`,F,x,he=`Most importantly, for our everyday users, this makes Spyder much more flexible and powerful when working with multiple Python environments.
With the changes, Spyder itself does not need to be present in every environment you’d like to launch a kernel in; you can install the full IDE in whatever manner you prefer, and then set it to run code and consoles in any Anaconda environment, <code>virtualenv</code>/<code>venv</code>, or even a totally separate Python installation, so long as it has <code>spyder-kernels</code> package available.
Just set the path under <code>Tools -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Python interpreter -&gt; Use the following Python interpreter</code> to the desired Python executable, and any new Console you open will start in the selected environment.
Check out our <a href="https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/wiki/Working-with-packages-and-environments-in-Spyder" rel="nofollow" class="link">new wiki page on using environments with Spyder</a>, for more details and tips on the subject, and keep an eye out for the further improvements coming in Spyder 4, which will greatly simplify the process and include full GUI-based project, package and environment management functionality built right in.`,L,k,ue,J,P,pe=`Furthermore, the new package allows you to independently launch a kernel from anywhere (on your local computer, or a remote machine, server or even supercomputing cluster), connect to it with Spyder, and use it just like a “natively” started one.
After installing <code>spyder-kernels</code> on the host environment, you can start one with <code>python -m spyder_kernels.console</code>, and then enter the kernel’s 4-digit ID (and SSH connection details, if a remote machine) in the Spyder <code>Connect to an existing kernel</code> dialog under the IPython Console pane context- or “gear”-menu).
For more information on the process, see the <a href="https://docs.spyder-ide.org/ipythonconsole.html#connecting-to-a-console" rel="nofollow" class="link">Connecting to a Console</a> section in our new documentation.`,q,C,ae,$,S,Se=`Best of all, no matter how or where a kernel is started, every console now supports the full suite of Spyder’s features, including completion, the Variable Explorer, interactive Help and more, unlike before.
You can even mix and match internal, external and remote kernels in different environments, all in the same Spyder session, by either changing the Python interpreter preferences setting between starting a console, or starting and connecting to multiple consoles externally—or both!
Finally, for those of us (and those of you!) who help develop Spyder, the changes also make it easier to maintain and improve the code, and opens the door to one of the biggest features coming in Spyder 4: a new, full-featured debugging kernel that many of you have been asking for.`,U,T,Me=`The one key thing to remember: make sure you install the appropriate version of <code>spyder-kernels</code> for your version of Spyder. For most users, that will be spyder-kernels 0.x (currently 0.2.6) to match Spyder 3 on our stable <code>3.x</code> branch; if testing a Spyder 4 beta or Github clone of the <code>master</code> branch, you’ll want the latest 1.x version of <code>spyder-kernels</code> (currently 1.1.0).
To install the correct build, you can use the following <code>conda</code> command,`,M,b,be,ce='<code class="language-bash">conda <span class="token function">install</span> spyder-kernels<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token operator">&lt;</span><span class="token number">0</span> or <span class="token operator"><span class="token file-descriptor important">1</span>></span>.*</code>',W,je,ne="or with <code>pip</code>,",X,De,K,N='<code class="language-bash">pip <span class="token function">install</span> spyder-kernels<span class="token operator">==</span><span class="token operator">&lt;</span><span class="token number">0</span> or <span class="token operator"><span class="token file-descriptor important">1</span>></span>.*</code>',We,V,R=`replacing <code>&lt;0 or 1&gt;</code> with the major version number (0 or 1) to match your Spyder version.

This allows for advanced completion functionality on objects not yet assigned to a variable, similar to the existing “greedy” completion option, but without the need for dynamic evaluation.
It can be slow if working with very large Pandas <code>DataFrames</code> so it is disabled by default, but you can activate it under <code>Tools -&gt; Preferences -&gt; IPython console -&gt; Advanced Settings -&gt; Jedi completion</code>.
The descriptive text for the “greedy” completion option (also off by default) was also clarified, particularly to explain an IPython bug (not present in the <code>jedi</code> completer) with the feature and a consequent workaround.`,Je,_,H,Ye,Q,Y=`We’ve also added a new plotting setting, <code>Use a tight layout for inline plots</code>, for the <code>Inline</code> Matplotlib graphics backend.
The default behavior (as in previous Spyder versions) sets <code>bbox_inches</code> to <code>&quot;tight&quot;</code> in Matplotlib calls when drawing to the inline backend.
However, if you prefer your own <code>bbox_inches</code> argument be respected even when plots are rendered in the Console, you can now do so by unchecking this option under <code>Tools -&gt; Preferences -&gt; IPython console -&gt; Graphics -&gt; Inline backend</code>.`,Xe,Z,ee,et,ze,ge="Better Variable Explorer usability and performance",tt,Ge,me=`We’ve made several changes and optimizations to greatly improve performance and efficiency in the Variable Explorer, to make it much faster and use less memory when opening and editing large objects.
In particular, we’ve fixed several major memory leaks when saving edited objects and closing the Variable Explorer dialogs through better length validation and garbage collection, and now skip the whole saving process entirely if the object was not modified (or cannot be modified).
We’ve also changed the names and functions of the <code>Cancel</code> and <code>Ok</code> buttons in Variable Explorer dialogs to be easier to understand and use.
They now feature a <code>Close</code> button which exits the dialog without saving any edits to the object’s contents, and a <code>Save and Close</code> button—automatically enabled once modifications are made—that commits the changes back to the kernel.`,nt,B,oe,lt,qe,Ie="Streamlined error reporting experience",at,Oe,Le=`While we hope you never need to use it, Spyder 3.3.0 includes a brand-new error handling backend that can submit bug reports directly through the Github API.

Either way, Spyder can securely remember your login using the <a href="https://github.com/jaraco/keyring" rel="nofollow" class="link"><code>keyring</code></a> package, so you only have to do this once on any given machine (if you select the “remember” option).`,dt,Re,Ae,rt,Ze,Ee=`The dialog itself has also been made more functional and user-friendly, designed to help encourage high-quality, useful reports, and with more accessible, descriptive text.

Finally, we’ve fixed over 40 bugs in this release and further improved our documentation and troubleshooting material, so hopefully you’ll see this less often.`,ot,w,j="Cleaner under the hood and more",ht,ut,Ue=`Alongside the aforementioned internal changes, we’ve also made a number of other under-the-hood changes to clean out old cruft and improve maintainability, readability and performance of our codebase.
In particular, we’ve officially dropped support for Python 3.3, PyQt4, and PyQt5 under 5.5, all versions which have been end-of-life for years, and (aside from PyQt4) have minimal or no remaining Spyder users.
Furthermore, dropping <code>PyQt4</code> in particular allows us to avoid or resolve a number of unfixable bugs specific to that version that have been causing problems for users, and opens the door to easier development in the future.
Finally, we moved our legacy documentation (and its many associated images) from the main Spyder codebase to <a href="https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder-docs" rel="nofollow" class="link">its own repo</a>, executed a major overhaul to greatly modernize and expand the text, images, style, and presentation, and now deploy them onto <a href="https://docs.spyder-ide.org/" rel="nofollow" class="link">their own subdomain of our site</a>, all of which we will discuss in a separate post coming soon.`,pt,A,de="Even more fixes and refinements with Spyder 3.3.1",ft,m,y=`As a quick follow-on to the 3.3.0 release, Spyder 3.3.1 fixed a handful of bugs and minor issues with the new functionality and cleaned up several other existing ones, as well made a number of lower-level maintenance and development-oriented changes—over two dozen in all.
Furthermore, several user-visible enhancements made it into the release, primary aimed at improving usability.
To make it easier for users to manage multiple environments, the selection UI under <code>Preferences &gt; Python interpreter &gt; Use the following Python interpreter</code> remembers the executables you’ve previously selected and allows quick switching between them.`,_e,St,Mt,$t,E,Ce=`In the Console, mundane <code>ipdb</code> commands are automatically filtered from the history, and the Editor now supports syntax highlighting for the <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0515/" rel="nofollow" class="link">new numeric literal syntax</a> introduced in Python 3.6.
Spyder’s tutorial has been re-written for modern Spyder as well as to be clearer and more understandable, and overhauled for better and more consistent formatting and visuals with the rest of our documentation.
Finally, our update checker now consults the Anaconda <code>defaults</code> channel rather than PyPI to determine if an update is available, so it doesn’t bug the majority of our users on Anaconda until they can actually acquire the package.`,Gt,Ht,Et="What to know and what’s next",qt,Lt,At=`If you have any questions, problems or feedback, we’d love to hear from you (just make sure you read our <a href="https://docs.spyder-ide.org/" rel="nofollow" class="link">documentation</a>, <a href="https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/wiki/Troubleshooting-Guide-and-FAQ" rel="nofollow" class="link">Troubleshooting Guide</a> and the other previously-mentioned resources first)!

I decided to wait until now to write a blogpost about it because shortly after the initial release, we found several critical performance issues and some regressions with respect to Spyder 3, most of which are fixed now in <a href="https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/releases/tag/v4.1.3" rel="nofollow" class="link">version 4.1.3</a>, released on May 8th 2020.`,u,c,re=`This new release comes with a lengthy list of user-requested features aimed at providing an enhanced development experience at the level of top general-purpose editors and IDEs, while strengthening Spyder’s specialized focus on scientific programming in Python.
The interested reader can take a look at some of them in <a href="https://www.spyder-ide.org/blog/spyder-variable-explorer/" rel="nofollow" class="link">previous</a> <a href="https://www.spyder-ide.org/blog/spyder-files-improvements/" rel="nofollow" class="link">blog</a> <a href="https://www.spyder-ide.org/blog/spyder-kite-funding/" rel="nofollow" class="link">posts</a>, and in detail in our <a href="https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#version-400-2019-12-06" rel="nofollow" class="link">Changelog</a>.
However, this post is not meant to describe those improvements, but to acknowledge all people that contributed to making Spyder 4 possible.`,O,v,fe=`Spyder 4 is the first version developed with financial support from multiple companies and organizations, as well as donations by the international user community.
However, as a project, we couldn’t have been able to reach the level of maturity needed to receive and handle that support without the pivotal opportunities Travis Oliphant, former CEO of Anaconda and current leader of Quansight, gave me to work in Scientific Python.
Thanks to him, I became part of Anaconda Inc. in 2015; I was able to hire a small small team to improve Spyder within Anaconda in late 2016; and I was hired by Quansight to work solely on Spyder in 2018.
As with other projects in our ecosystem, such as <a href="https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh" rel="nofollow" class="link">Bokeh</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dask/dask" rel="nofollow" class="link">Dask</a> and <a href="https://github.com/numba/numba" rel="nofollow" class="link">Numba</a>, Spyder benefited immensely from Travis’ trust in the role these efforts and ours could play in the future.
He certainly believed in the vision their maintainers worked so hard to make a reality, even if their beginnings were humble and their chances of survival uncertain.
Therefore, my first big acknowledgment is to Travis: thanks for giving us a chance!`,F,x,he=`I also want to thank our community for its continued support.
As I’ve witnessed during my years as Spyder’s lead developer, many newbies and veterans alike keep choosing Spyder as their primary tool for scientific programming in Python.
It’s really you, the members of this fantastic community, which keep Spyder relevant in a highly competitive field by using and contributing back to it.
Furthermore, when the future looked grim, after my team and I were let go from Anaconda at the end of 2017 (not by Travis’ decision), a lot of users came to our rescue by making donations through our <a href="https://opencollective.com/spyder" rel="nofollow" class="link">Open Collective page</a>.
That, and a NumFOCUS development grant we received the next year, filled us with confidence and allowed us to continue with Spyder’s development in 2018, even after losing part of our team in the process.`,L,k,ue=`Last year it was also a pleasant surprise to learn that several companies were interested in seeing Spyder prosper and thrive.
Through Quansight Labs and its <a href="https://labs.quansight.org/blog/2019/05/community-driven-opensource-funded-development/" rel="nofollow" class="link">Community Work Order</a> concept, we were able to sign contracts with two of them: <a href="https://www.micronas.tdk.com/en" rel="nofollow" class="link">TDK-Micronas</a> and <a href="https://kite.com/" rel="nofollow" class="link">Kite</a>.
Their support was critical to finish Spyder 4 because it allowed me to hire most of my old Anaconda team back, plus two new additions, to work full-time on the project.
Therefore, I can’t thank them enough for showing up just at the right time!`,J,P,pe=`And finally, even when I am often seen as the public face of Spyder, due to my presence in our <a href="https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/issues" rel="nofollow" class="link">issue tracker</a> and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/438386/carlos-cordoba" rel="nofollow" class="link">Stack Overflow</a>, it’s really the Spyder team that is in charge of implementing new features and fixing most bugs.
So my last round of acknowledgments goes to them.
I was fortunate enough to convince some of the most talented Colombian software developers to work for the project, and to attract the interest of several other equally accomplished developers from around the world.
All of them did a hell of a job in this release!`,q,C,ae=`<a href="https://github.com/jnsebgosselin" rel="nofollow" class="link">Jean-Sébastien Gosselin</a> contributed our new Plots pane in its entirety; <a href="https://github.com/impact27" rel="nofollow" class="link">Quentin Peter</a> did a complete re-architecting of our IPython console, which enabled numerous improvements to our debugger; <a href="https://github.com/jitseniesen" rel="nofollow" class="link">Jitse Niesen</a> added auto-saving functionality to our editor; <a href="https://github.com/bcolsen" rel="nofollow" class="link">Brian Olsen</a> contributed the initial implementation of the <code>runcell</code> command; and <a href="https://github.com/CAM-Gerlach" rel="nofollow" class="link">CAM Gerlach</a> made significant improvements to our documentation.

In <a href="https://www.spyder-ide.org/blog/reusable-research-bof-scipy-2023/" rel="nofollow" class="link">Part 1 of this two-part series</a>, we went over our motivation and goals for the session and the challenges that attendees brought up.

In response, one participant mentioned that VSCode recently made <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks#_custom-notebook-diffing" rel="nofollow" class="link">an improvement</a> to the notebook diff viewers to more easily show just the code changes.
However, users stressed that it was critical to be able to diff the actual notebook output, not just its contents, and expressed a desire for a tool to cover that aspect.`,O,v,fe=`In response to these concerns, others responded that notebooks should not be considered a unit of reproducible research, which should instead be a complete software project, including notebooks or scripts, an environment/requirements file and a record of commands to run there.
They recommended the <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/blog/8-levels-of-reproducibility" rel="nofollow" class="link">8-levels of Reproducibility</a> and <a href="https://github.com/conda-incubator/conda-project" rel="nofollow" class="link">Conda Project</a> to help guide and implement this.`,F,x,he=`Additionally, attendees recommended <a href="https://papermill.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" rel="nofollow" class="link">Papermill</a>, describing it as a very useful tool for parameterizing and executing notebooks programmatically.
Others suggested <a href="https://containers.dev/" rel="nofollow" class="link">Devcontainers</a>, to allow collaborating with a lab group or team in a shared environment and seeing everything on their screen, as well as <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/learn/collaboration/live-share" rel="nofollow" class="link">Live Share in VSCode</a>.`,L,k,ue=`Participants also expressed frustration that despite notebooks being intended to make programming more literate, this often does not happen in practice.
Beginners like the interactivity in notebooks because they don’t know how to use more advanced programming tools, but they don’t always take advantage of their readability features.
To address this, attendees stressed the importance of getting users accustomed to best practices that can also be helpful for reproducibility.
A participant mentioned a <code>nbflake8</code> tool to lint notebooks, though it could not be easily found online, and others wished for a <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/1218" rel="nofollow" class="link">Ruff implementation</a> (which at the time of this writing is <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/5188" rel="nofollow" class="link">now complete</a>).`,J,P,pe="Migrating notebooks to modules",q,C,ae=`As one participant put it, “I love notebooks, and also love modules, and love the flow of code from notebooks into modules once it approaches that point.”
They went on to describe modules as a key unit of documented, tested code, but which doesn’t mean a lot on its own, whereas combined with a notebook, it gives them context and meaning.
For communities that may be afraid of modules, the participant recommended trying to make creating and transitioning to them easier, so users have fully importable, reusable Python code.
For students, notebooks often turn into a fancy scratch pad or script file, and once they get stuff that works, they can move that stuff out into modules, and then the notebooks start to morph into examples and the history of what the work was about that can be interpreted by other researchers.`,$,S,Se=`Other attendees chimed in with similar stories, with a NIST researcher mentioning this is an area they’d been working on for 10 years, with their approach being putting the stuff they want to be modular in a regular Python module, and then have a Jupyter notebook that shows an example using the code, such as in their <a href="https://github.com/usnistgov/iprPy" rel="nofollow" class="link">IPRPy project</a>.

According to attendees, its documentation mostly talks about everything as packages, but it can also be used for individual notebooks and modules.
Some participants were initially hesitant to show it to their students since they’re early Python programmers, but it was actually quite easy for them, only requiring as little as one line of code at the end.
(Unfortunately as of this writing, it seems ndbdev development <a href="https://hamel.dev/blog/posts/nbdev/" rel="nofollow" class="link">has stalled</a> due to its expected commercial opportunities not materializing.)
Others asked for more documentation resources for this, since they were still learning Python themselves and would like to learn more about this and teach it to their students.
In addition to this very blog post and guide, one attendee brought up that they did <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7zS8Ld4_iA" rel="nofollow" class="link">a tutorial on that topic at SciPy</a>, adding that the documentation is pretty intimidating but it would be great to have something more focused on smaller-scale usage.`,M,b,be=`As additional approaches, attendees mentioned they have their students use <a href="https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/" rel="nofollow" class="link">Jupytext</a>, which helps the student to convert notebooks to Python files that can be committed to a Git repository.

Attendees from NASA mentioned that for their projects everything has to be documented, and one of the things they’ve struggled with was converting a notebook to the type of report NASA is typically looking for.
Others described their workflow being as simple and “old school” as writing a <code>aaa_readme.txt</code> file where they record a diary of what they were doing on that project so if they have a break working on it, they can go back to those notes and remind themselves.`,K,N,We=`To help address this, participants recommended a “really cool” <a href="https://github.com/showyourwork/showyourwork" rel="nofollow" class="link">tool called “Show Your Work”</a> that comes out of the astrophysics community, which is primarily aimed at producing a paper at the end but also a Python package, and includes all the steps that show users’ work along the way.
It is built around a tool called <a href="https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/" rel="nofollow" class="link">Snakemake</a>, which then sets up a template for both the Python package and the paper.
Additionally, attendees described it as having a “really helpful” guide for getting started and ensuring all of a user’s projects have the same structure.

Others mentioned <a href="https://github.com/duecredit/duecredit/" rel="nofollow" class="link">Duecredit</a>, a related tool for citing open source authors which looks at code and finds the authors (via Git commits) that wrote it.`,ve,ie,Ke=`Additionally, users expressed particular appreciation for the <a href="https://github.com/scientific-python/cookie" rel="nofollow" class="link">Cookiecutter template</a> that <a href="https://iscinumpy.dev/" rel="nofollow" class="link">Henry Schreiner III</a> has for packaging.

To avoid that, enable the new <code>Ignore Python libraries while debugging</code> option in Spyder’s preferences under <code>IPython Console &gt; Debugger &gt; Debug</code>.
This will skip all the built-in and third-party Python modules and help you focus on your own code.`,Pe,le,Ve,Te,se,Je=`Another pain point for me is the mix of Pdb commands and Python statements when using the interactive prompt.
While debugging a script with a variable named <code>step</code>, for example, typing <code>step</code> in the Pdb prompt will not display the value of <code>step</code>, but will instead step through the code.
To avoid this, the Spyder 4.2 debugger will give precedence to Python expressions over Pdb commands; prefixing an expression with an exclamation mark will explicitly run it as a Pdb command.
This matches how the IPython Console handles clashes between magic functions and Python expressions, and contrasts with the previous behavior, where Pdb commands took precedence.

As Spyder was, is and always will be a community-developed and supported IDE, this was far from a mortal blow to the project, but it did impact the pace and breadth of development.
Developer effort previously spent on our Spyder plugins, like <a href="https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder-notebook" rel="nofollow" class="link">spyder-notebook</a>, <a href="https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder-reports" rel="nofollow" class="link">spyder-reports</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder-terminal" rel="nofollow" class="link">spyder-terminal</a>, among others, was refocused on the Spyder core, and the development and release of Spyder 4 was put mostly on hold.
To help make up for the loss of funding, we appealed to the community for support, asking users who found Spyder valuable to back our project on <a href="https://opencollective.com/spyder" rel="nofollow" class="link">OpenCollective</a>, in order to accelerate development and fund more features for Spyder 4.`,F,x,he,L,k,ue=`To our unending gratitude, you responded! In the few months since then, we’ve gone from zero to a budget of well over $4500 per year and rising at an increasing pace, thanks to the continuing contributions of over 80 (and counting!) individual and institutional backers.
We also had several new core team members and community contributors pitch in to help carry the load, and we’ve got some more great news in the very next post on the funding front.
While we’ve got a ways to go to match the level of funding we’ve received under Anaconda, your support has helped make possible several of the new features we’ve planned for Spyder 4, and allow us to commit to releasing it much sooner than we would be able to otherwise.
Your generous donations go directly toward funding the Spyder community’s most-requested new and improved features for Spyder 4, so keep them coming!
Stay tuned; we are considering rolling out new donation tiers and rewards at some point soon so you won’t want to miss that.`,J,P,pe="Development by the Numbers",q,C,ae=`On the development side of the project, while our overall pace is modestly lower than its peak under our Anaconda funding, we’ve been quite active fixing bugs and adding new features and enhancements over the past six months.
By the numbers, since mid-November, we’ve pushed approximately 1200 commits to <code>master</code> (Spyder 4), comprising over 37 000 lines added and 16 000 removed, and 900 commits to <code>3.x</code> (Spyder 3), with over 16 500 additions and 10 000 deletions.
Users have opened over 1375 issues (bugs, feature requests and other feedback), of which we’ve managed to resolve more than 1330, or nearly 97%.`,$,S,Se,U,T,Me=`Further, over 250 pull requests from almost two dozen unique contributors, some old, some new, have been submitted since that time—fixing bugs, adding new or enhanced functionality, or making other improvements—of which 226 have been merged to the main Spyder codebase.
This work has coalesced into four separate official releases during that period, with another only days away.
Finally, we’ve recently blown past the 3000 Github stars milestone a few weeks ago (we’re now at more than 3200), with almost 700 unique forks to date.`,M,b,be="Key Spyder Improvements",ce,W,je=`All those numbers are nice, but what matters most are the tangible improvements that you all get to use every day in your favorite IDE.
Over those same past six months, alongside hundreds of bugfixes and minor enhancements, we’ve made multiple significant improvements to the Spyder 3 Editor, IPython Console, Variable Explorer, and Find in Files tool, along with a number of others under the hood and to the application as a whole.
Even better, the majority of these were suggested by you, our users, and some of you even pitched in to help implement them.`,ne,X,De=`Especially since you will probably be spending most of your time in it, we added a several new commands and functions to the <strong>Editor</strong> that will hopefully make your life easier, each with corresponding customizable shortcuts for easier access.
You can now insert a new line below the current one regardless of the cursor’s current position with <code>Ctrl-Shift-Enter</code>, and you can now use <code>Shift-Delete</code> to cut selected text, and <code>Shift-Insert</code> to paste it.
<code>Ctrl-PageUp</code>, <code>Ctrl-PageDown</code>, and <code>Ctrl-Tab</code> shortcuts are all now fully configurable.
Finally, you can now easily <code>Tab</code> from the <code>Find</code> to the <code>Replace</code> box when open, and better yet your <code>Find</code> text is automatically copied to the <code>Replace</code> box to make modifications easier.`,K,N,We=`Second only to the Editor in terms of them most critical Spyder components, the <strong>IPython Console</strong> also got a lot of love in recent releases.
We’ve made several improvements to significantly improve the startup time, and added an optional feature to show the elapsed time each kernel has been running.
You can now remove all user-defined variables with a GUI command, and changes in <code>import</code>ed modules now take effect instantly and automatically in the console, without even a re-<code>import</code> needed.
<code>Cloudpickle</code> is now used to serialize objects from the Console to the Variable Explorer, greatly improving the latter’s capabilities (as discussed below).
Finally, Cython files are now automatically run in dedicated Cython consoles, and you can now use the edit magic command from the Console to open any file right inside Spyder’s Editor.`,V,R,Ne,ve,ie,Ke=`The <strong>Variable Explorer</strong>, which many of you cite as Spyder’s “killer feature”, has greatly improved as well.
Most notably, thanks to the aforementioned <code>cloudpickle</code> change, you now have access to rich, deep exploration of nearly any object, builtin or custom, and can traverse, view, and when possible even edit complex hierarchies of nested types with ease.
The Variable Explorer now fully supports <code>Timedelta</code> objects, both built-in and <code>Pandas</code> variants, allowing you to easily view and edit them just like <code>datetime</code> and <code>Timestamp</code>.
It also now uses a “pretty”, more human-readable format for dates, times, timedeltas and the like, and also now supports displaying a much wider range of <code>Numpy</code> array types.
As a quality of life change, it has much better handling of immutable types, like <code>tuples</code>, clearly showing they can’t be edited upfront and avoiding bothersome errors when trying to do so.`,Pe,le,Ve=`Rounding out the major changes, the <strong>Find in Files</strong> tool now allows you to remove items from the <code>Search In</code> list by hovering over them and pressing <code>Delete</code>, and there’s also a new option to clear all recent directories.
Under the hood, we’ve made <code>PyQt5</code> a dependency for easier, one-command installation and added many more tests and better project infrastructure to help catch errors.
To make things easier on you if something does go wrong, we’ve greatly improved the error reporting system, the UI/UX and the explanatory text to be more up to date, informative, and user friendly.`,Te,se,Je,_,H,Ye=`All of the mentioned additions are included in the latest released version of Spyder, 3.2.8, which you can update to with <code>conda update spyder</code> (if using Anaconda), with your package manager/distribution (if installed that way) or with <code>pip update spyder</code> (otherwise).
Even more are already implemented for our next release, due out in a week’s time, and we’ll have a preview of what to expect right here on the blog even sooner.`,Q,Y,Xe="Affiliated Project Progress",Z,ee,et=`Outside the core Spyder IDE, while most plugins have been paused until the Spyder 4 release, work on other affiliated projects has continued. The new <a href="https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder-unittest" rel="nofollow" class="link">spyder-unittest</a> plugin has seen particularly active development, and lead developer and Spyder team member <a href="http://www1.maths.leeds.ac.uk/~jitse/" rel="nofollow" class="link">Jitse Niesen</a> recently published a <a href="https://www.spyder-ide.org/blog/introducing-unittest-plugin/" rel="nofollow" class="link">tutorial on its use</a>.
Since November, it has gotten improved <code>pytest</code> support with realtime test results and click-to-open, better UI/UX, a robust communications backend (ZeroMQ), and numerous bug fixes and minor improvements.
<a href="https://github.com/spyder-ide/qtpy" rel="nofollow" class="link">QtPy</a>, another affiliated project which Spyder uses as its Qt GUI abstraction layer, has had three releases including one major, with new Qt classes, early support for <code>PySide2</code>, better performance, and a number of bugfixes.`,ze,ge,tt,Ge,me,nt=`Other projects under the Spyder umbrella are also making major progress. The <a href="https://github.com/spyder-ide/pywinpty" rel="nofollow" class="link">pywinpty</a> pseudo-terminal library has seen six official releases (three major), with a new rich high level interface to create and track processes, new process wrappers, Python 2.7 support, major performance, stability and security improvements, and many bug fixes.
Most importantly, we are proud to report that since this January Jupyter Notebook (in 5.3.0) and JupyterLab have both adopted it to create and manage system terminals on Windows!
The <a href="https://github.com/spyder-ide/qtsass" rel="nofollow" class="link">qtsass</a> SASS to Qt stylesheet compiler has a new maintainer, with development including new dev infrastructure, refactoring work, a PyPI release, and new features, with more on the way.
Finally, our <a href="https://github.com/spyder-ide/loghub" rel="nofollow" class="link">loghub</a> automatic changelog generator has seen significant internal and external developer interest, as well as three releases, bug fixes, additional examples, and the ability to group issues and PRs together if desired.

The award runs from May through this November, and will enable multiple betas with new features to be released throughout 2018, with the first feature-complete release candidate of Spyder 4 planned by the year’s end (we’ll have more detail on all that in Part 3).

The father of much of the modern PyData ecosystem including NumPy, SciPy and Numba, Travis has been instrumental in the dramatic growth of open-source data analysis with Python through founding or helping lead Enthought, Continuum/Anaconda, NumFOCUS, and more.
Quansight, Travis’ newest venture, focuses on scaling up the PyData ecosystem to solve even larger and more integrated problems, connecting companies with the open-source tools that can benefit their business, and helping build a more robust ecosystem for open-source scientific development.`,J,P,pe=`As part of that mission, Carlos was hired through at least the end of 2018 to help make several open-source projects more sustainable in the long run, and I’m sure you all will be happy to hear that one of them will be our very own Spyder!
After previously helping support the project over at Anaconda, Travis and Quansight will fund Carlos to work part-time on Spyder development, helping the project continue to grow and evolve, and keeping Spyder 4 moving along at a faster pace.
Congratulations Carlos, and thanks to Travis and Quansight!`,q,C,ae=`Aside from those two, we also have several other potential long-term funding opportunities in the pipeline.
Stay tuned to hear more about those in the coming months.`,$,S,Se="Spyder 3.3.0 Ready to Go",U,T,Me=`Meanwhile, on the development side of things, we’ve just finished the rollout of the next update in the stable Spyder 3 line, 3.3.0, and will have a full post shortly going over the changes and enhancements in detail.
In brief, it has some significant under the hood revisions, cleaning house of some old end of life dependencies and legacy support (Python 3.3 and PyQt4 below 5.5), and separates the IPython Console kernel code into a new <code>spyder-kernels</code> package to make it easier for you to work with different Python environments and remote sessions, and easier for us to add exciting new features down the road.
Additionally, it adds new preferences options for console plotting and autocompletion, improves the usability and performance of Variable Explorer object viewers, includes a new, fully automated error reporting feature to make submitting reports faster, easier and more helpful, and contains a number of other minor improvements and usability enhancements, along with numerous bug fixes.`,M,b,be,ce,W,je="Spyder 4 Public Beta 1 on Deck",ne,X,De=`We’ll also be releasing the first public beta of Spyder 4 in the very near future, to allow users and developers to get their hands on the next generation of the IDE and start using and testing it as soon as possible.
There are far too many significant new features to list here, and they are more than worthy of their own full-length post, as there are many substantial changes to the Editor, Console, Variable Explorer, File Explorer, Outline Explorer, API and more.`,K,N,We,V,R,Ne=`Some of the major highlights in the Editor include code folding, indentation guides, multiple line length indicators, a live class/method/function panel (<em>a la</em> Visual Studio), many more shortcut commands, better comment/uncomment, and more.
The IPython Console gains the ability to start specialized Pylab, SymPy, and Cython consoles, and the Variable Explorer gets MultiIndex support, now natively handles all Pandas indexers, and can display sets in a dedicated GUI editor.
Meanwhile, the File Explorer now has multi-select functionality and can open any file with the user’s OS-configured external default program, while the outline explorer can now group items by cell, and in multiple levels.
Finally, Spyder 4 exposes a public API for external plugins, offers more language translations, features several global UI improvements and has numerous under the hood and refactoring changes, and countless other enhancements big and small.
It’s the future of Spyder, so if you’d like to get a taste of the cutting edge,  we’d love for you to try it when it drops and let us know what you think!`,ve,ie,Ke="Spyder Documentation, Reborn",Pe,le,Ve=`Aside from Spyder 3 and 4, we’ve got another big ticket item for you all in the next few days: our brand new docs!
We’ve been working on a major overhaul of our documentation, which will saw its first official release with Spyder 3.3.0.
Our <a href="https://pythonhosted.org/spyder/" rel="nofollow" class="link">old docs</a> were hosted on PyPI/PythonHosted and, with the freezing of that service, couldn’t be updated.
Therefore, we’ve now moved to maintain them in a <a href="https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder-docs" rel="nofollow" class="link">new dedicated repo</a>, build, deploy and host them ourselves with <a href="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/" rel="nofollow" class="link">Sphinx</a>, <a href="https://drdoctr.github.io/doctr/" rel="nofollow" class="link">doctr</a> and <a href="https://pages.github.com/" rel="nofollow" class="link">Github Pages</a> on a subdomain of our new site making them more convenient, responsive and accessible.`,Te,se,Je,_,H,Ye=`Furthermore, we’ve taken the opportunity to perform a comprehensive overhaul from top to bottom, dramatically improving their usefulness to users.
We’ve greatly expanded many pages and sections and adding new ones, updated outdated references, performed an exhaustive copyedit over nearly every line of the text, developed and implemented a consistent style guide, transitioned to a modern theme with our own custom CSS extensions, added or replaced many  dozens of high-resolution screenshots, modified the source code and infrastructure to be easier to develop, build and maintain, and much more.
Even better, you can expect even more improvements in the coming months, as we further expand them toward the standard you’d expect for a feature-rich, multifaceted application like Spyder.

To expose this new functionality, we decided to set the option to hide arbitrary Python objects in the Variable Explorer to disabled by default, and introduced a new one called <code>Exclude callables and modules</code>.

science and scientific computing in Python. And focused on growing communities
around those technologies. That’s how I see it for Spyder as well: Quansight
Labs enables developers to be employed to work on Spyder, and helps with
connecting them to developers of other projects in similar situations. Labs
should be an enabler to let the Spyder project, its community and individual
developers grow. And Labs provides mechanisms to attract and coordinate
funding. Of course the project is still independent. If there are other
funding sources, e.g. donations from individuals to Spyder via OpenCollective,
all the better.”</p>`,F,x,he="Multiple Projects aka Workspaces",L,k,ue=`In its current state Spyder can only handle one active project at a time.

At first, I didn’t actually understand how important docs are for software, especially for open source projects.
However, during all this time I’ve learned how documentation has a huge impact on the open-source community and I’ve been thankful to have been able to do this.
But, from the beginning, I asked myself “why am I the ‘right person’ for this?”`,u,c,re=`Improving Spyder’s documentation started as part of a NumFOCUS Small Development Grant awarded at the end of last year.
The goal of the project was not only to <a href="https://docs.spyder-ide.org/develop/" rel="nofollow" class="link">update the documentation</a> for Spyder 4, but also to make it more user-friendly, so users can understand Spyder’s key concepts and get started with it more easily.`,O,v,fe="One of the main ideas for this project was to create a series of short video tutorials, explaining the basic functionality of Spyder and its most important panes, allowing users to learn how to use Spyder faster and easier.",F,x,he="Carlos Cordoba, our lead maintainer, thought I was the perfect person for this project because of my “good communication and organization skills”, my “clear and fluent English” (his words) and my previous experience at video editing and recording, which I actually gained by recording singing videos during my “YouTuber” phase.",L,k,ue=`I’ve always been interested in education and worked as a tutor for several years learning different tools, gaining experience on how to teach and questioning the effectiveness of current educational methods.
This was the first reason why I got interested in this project.
For me, documentation is just a fancy way of saying “educating people on using software”.
The challenge here was not recording and editing the videos (which was actually a pretty arduous task), or planning the content for them; the real challenge was to make an impact in such a way that users could find documentation actually useful.`,J,P,pe=`When users start to use a new IDE, or any new software, they usually refer to its documentation, which sometimes doesn’t give enough tools for them to start from zero.
This was, then, the whole purpose of the tutorial videos.
Spyder’s documentation was already very complete in terms of explaining all the features and cool things you can do with each of its panes.
However, if I’m a completely new user and I don’t even know how to open it, where do I start?`,q,C,ae=`I planned these videos as a series of progressive steps that can get users from zero experience to actually working with Spyder.
Hence, I divided the videos into three sections, “First Steps with Spyder”, “Working with Spyder”, and “Building Projects with Spyder”.
Each section builds on the one before in a way that they are clear enough so that users can find their way through Spyder without knowing anything about it.`,$,S,Se=`The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPonohdiDqg9epClEcXoAPUiK0pN5eRoc" rel="nofollow" class="link">“First Steps with Spyder”</a> section, live now on our YouTube channel, has three videos that provide a starting point for new users before they even open Spyder for the first time.
The <a href="https://youtu.be/E2Dap5SfXkI" rel="nofollow" class="link">first tutorial</a> covers different ways of opening Spyder, the basics of using its interface and an introduction to its four main panes, along with a quick look at the others so that users can get familiar with how Spyder is organized.`,U,T,Me=`In the <a href="https://youtu.be/WV9bm4ey7Cg" rel="nofollow" class="link">second video</a>, users can learn the basics of using Spyder’s four main panes.
The goal is that after this video, users are able to open and edit a file in the Editor, run a script and find the output in Spyder’s IPython Console and execute basic Python commands.
They should be able to interact with the Variable Explorer to browse and edit the objects in the console, and use the Help pane to get documentation in two different ways.`,M,b,be=`The <a href="https://youtu.be/-dARZBUDk_s" rel="nofollow" class="link">third video</a> is meant to show users how to customize Spyder’s interface to start working with it in the way they feel more comfortable according to their preferences.
It teaches users how to change the font and the theme of Spyder and rearrange its panes to display only the ones that they want such that it is easier for them to work.`,ce,W,je=`After these three videos, I learned that one of the most important things for writing documentation, more than having a lot of experience with the software, is empathy.
Usually being a developer makes it hard to put yourself in the position of a user and understand exactly what a user needs.
Now, I realize that this is what actually makes me the “perfect person” for the project.
As a junior developer, without as much experience with Spyder, I was able to think more like new users and develop content in a way that they feel closer to us developers.
In the end, as Melissa said in her <a href="https://labs.quansight.org/blog/2020/03/documentation-as-a-way-to-build-community/" rel="nofollow" class="link">blog post</a>, I learned writing documentation is also a way of building community.`,ne,X,De="I hope these videos are really useful, and I look forward to continue finding ways of making the open source community better.",K,N,We="Happy Spydering!";return{c(){n=o("p"),n.innerHTML=f,p=s(),h=o("p"),h.innerHTML=a,u=s(),c=o("p"),c.innerHTML=re,O=s(),v=o("p"),v.textContent=fe,F=s(),x=o("p"),x.textContent=he,L=s(),k=o("p"),k.textContent=ue,J=s(),P=o("p"),P.textContent=pe,q=s(),C=o("p"),C.textContent=ae,$=s(),S=o("p"),S.innerHTML=Se,U=s(),T=o("p"),T.innerHTML=Me,M=s(),b=o("p"),b.innerHTML=be,ce=s(),W=o("p"),W.innerHTML=je,ne=s(),X=o("p"),X.textContent=De,K=s(),N=o("p"),N.textContent=We},l(V){n=l(V,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),r(n)!=="svelte-1c3xat3"&&(n.innerHTML=f),p=i(V),h=l(V,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),r(h)!=="svelte-1ekmroj"&&(h.innerHTML=a),u=i(V),c=l(V,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),r(c)!=="svelte-3uobbg"&&(c.innerHTML=re),O=i(V),v=l(V,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),r(v)!=="svelte-1nsl4ig"&&(v.textContent=fe),F=i(V),x=l(V,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),r(x)!=="svelte-13wakb2"&&(x.textContent=he),L=i(V),k=l(V,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),r(k)!=="svelte-8i2tyt"&&(k.textContent=ue),J=i(V),P=l(V,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),r(P)!=="svelte-1taoegn"&&(P.textContent=pe),q=i(V),C=l(V,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),r(C)!=="svelte-ovfvik"&&(C.textContent=ae),$=i(V),S=l(V,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),r(S)!=="svelte-uwjnw4"&&(S.innerHTML=Se),U=i(V),T=l(V,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),r(T)!=="svelte-q2p4uz"&&(T.innerHTML=Me),M=i(V),b=l(V,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),r(b)!=="svelte-4qc8rx"&&(b.innerHTML=be),ce=i(V),W=l(V,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),r(W)!=="svelte-ixkqq3"&&(W.innerHTML=je),ne=i(V),X=l(V,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),r(X)!=="svelte-aq4wil"&&(X.textContent=De),K=i(V),N=l(V,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),r(N)!=="svelte-11fpu20"&&(N.textContent=We)},m(V,R){t(V,n,R),t(V,p,R),t(V,h,R),t(V,u,R),t(V,c,R),t(V,O,R),t(V,v,R),t(V,F,R),t(V,x,R),t(V,L,R),t(V,k,R),t(V,J,R),t(V,P,R),t(V,q,R),t(V,C,R),t(V,$,R),t(V,S,R),t(V,U,R),t(V,T,R),t(V,M,R),t(V,b,R),t(V,ce,R),t(V,W,R),t(V,ne,R),t(V,X,R),t(V,K,R),t(V,N,R)},p:wt,d(V){V&&(e(n),e(p),e(h),e(u),e(c),e(O),e(v),e(F),e(x),e(L),e(k),e(J),e(P),e(q),e(C),e($),e(S),e(U),e(T),e(M),e(b),e(ce),e(W),e(ne),e(X),e(K),e(N))}}}function va(g){let n,f;const p=[g[0],Pn];let h={$$slots:{default:[ga]},$$scope:{ctx:g}};for(let a=0;a<p.length;a+=1)h=$e(h,p[a]);return n=new Tt({props:h}),{c(){xt(n.$$.fragment)},l(a){kt(n.$$.fragment,a)},m(a,u){_t(n,a,u),f=!0},p(a,[u]){const c=u&1?Pt(p,[u&1&&Qe(a[0]),u&0&&Qe(Pn)]):{};u&2&&(c.$$scope={dirty:u,ctx:a}),n.$set(c)},i(a){f||(yt(n.$$.fragment,a),f=!0)},o(a){mt(n.$$.fragment,a),f=!1},d(a){Ct(n,a)}}}const Pn={title:"Writing docs is not just writing docs",author:"juanis2112",tags:"Spyder4, docs",category:"Documentation",pub_date:"2020-07-08T00:00:00.000Z",summary:"I joined the Spyder team almost two years ago, and I never thought I was going to end up working on docs.
